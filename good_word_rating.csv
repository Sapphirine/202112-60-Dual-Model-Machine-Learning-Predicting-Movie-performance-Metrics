Rumble,"['hrkGNaYOv5k', 'QbE5JpYWhGk', 'h3zG5OLexjg', 'EFufpmgvSvc', '_WocjU3OOUQ']","['Rumble People are saying this is basically furry WWE. Here’s the thing:\n\nWWE actually co-produced this movie Its all fun and games until one monster throws another into the crowd and like 2,000 people die I love the character designs and the idea of monster wrestling, but in terms of the plot, I hope it turns out to be more interesting than it looks here, and doesn\'t just turn out to be another ""Po Vs. Guy Gagne"" story I\'m actually really curious to see where they go with a story like this. And can\'t wait to see what ideas they have for G/t interactions in a world where the monsters and humans are coexisting. This season of Bojack has really gone off the rails Those tentacles that turn into arms have some really cool movements. The smooth transition between arms and separation, it looks cool The phrase \'let\'s get ready to rumble\' is trademarked, so probably a good chunk of this movie\'s budget went to pay for it... pretty stupid way to spend money Couple things.\n\n1: Please let Godzilla cameo in SOME capacity. Maybe reference an older champion that fits his description. Finally something new for once. The animation looks good and this looks like it has potential. Dont know about you, but I see this getting a whole franchise. I just hope this movie doesn\'t suck. Are they not worried that if one of them falls out the ring, they can crush a bunch of people Not gonna lie, this year\'s WrestleMania looks pretty amazing. WWE really outdid themselves here. I can’t wait to see this movie, it looks awesome and totally hilarious Before the trailer was officially released on youtube, it was only available to watch if you saw sonic the hedgehog in theaters. As someone who has already watched the movie, I can say it is very enjoyable and comical at some points. If you have the chance I suggest you go see it, Its a great way to kill some time and you wont regret it. I gotta admit, this actually looks really good. I like the concept of a giant monster wrestling competition, practically a kaiju wrestling movie which i\'m surprised it hasn\'t been done before yet. The animation is surprisingly top notch, like it could easily pass off as a Disney, Pixar or Dreamworks film in terms of animation quality. The designs of the monsters i really like, especially the way the blue monster guy\'s tentacle arms shift in a way they work similar to hands, that i found really creative. All in all this looks like an actual fun movie which i\'m actually hyped for. 0:42 okay but that was smooth, like wow. I didnt fully realize his arms were 3 tentacles till he posed.  design is pretty cool, hes got like a Godzilla head situation going on but his design is pretty good. I actually really like the concept of kaiju wrestling. And honestly? I think the movie looks fun. It\'s been a while since I was actually quite excited for an animated movie. ""There has never been a champion quite like Tentacular.""\nGodzilla has entered the chat.\nGodzilla: Hold my beer. This movie is gonna make a whole new generation of furries.  \nOnly they’re gonna have macro fetishes now. Ever since Monstropolis co-existed with human world, Sullivan was not the same.\n\nSeriously the mane character looks weirdly like him but red and furless. So this whole movie\'s concept is basically the combination of Pokemon, WWE, and Reel Steel. This looks great. An original idea with really interesting designs. Animation isn\'t bad. Great rendering. The tentacle one\'s arm/tentacles thing is a really inspired idea. And the underdog\'s design is good. Kind of cute actually. They very easily couldn\'ve ended up with an unappealing design. For the people who are confused I\'m right there with ya!, Idk why this is now coming online early when we literally have at least two more family movies coming from Paramount this year, however I\'m very interested in seeing it Breath of the Wild: We made a huge muscular shark man, and everyone wants to screw him now...\nThis movie: hold my beer Love it! Love the wrestling aesthetic ️ This is going to be the best movie ever in my life * 2020 just begins *\n* trailer for a movie that comes out in 2021 * \n\nMe: wth? The world may not even be standing by then at this rate. You know, while the trailer doesn\'t do it much justice, the concept is actually kinda unique and funny.\n\nA film that takes the idea of your typical movie monster brawl, but makes it literally sport entertainment in the world they inhabit. While it maybe misplaced and it wouldn\'t surprise me if it turned out shit, I genuinely am looking forward to this This actually looks so funny. The red monster looks kind of cool and tough. God, can you imagine the amount of fanfiction that\'s going to come out once this is released? Oh boy… YEAH!!! finally we have an official trailer! This looks so fun! The author of the book, Monster on the Hill (the book that this movie is based on) came to my school today and it was a pretty cool experience. Pros:\nWill Arnett\nThe Animation\nThe Concept 1:25 ""Yeah that\'s gonna be a hard no for me""\nSums up my thoughts about this movie perfectly. If the movie is completed enough to have a trailer, why is it more than 10 months away from release?  That’s assuming it comes out January 2021 This is it. This is the movie that will convert me, I just know it That ""Chicago Bulls Theme Song"" though.. ️\nThen the ""Get ready for this"" by 2 Unlimited.\nHow doesn\'t this cartoon have to do with Basketball? I can\'t wait for this to come out good job on it  If this movie gets released in 2021 it will be coming\nNOTE: THIS MOVIE WILL COME IN 2021 THANK YOU PARAMOUNT COME ON I WAS UNIRONICALLY HYPED FOR THIS! For anyone who wants it, the song at the beginning is ""Sirius - Eye In The Sky""\n\n\nEdit: Here\'s a link to the song to make things easier: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkC_oi0ksuw&feature=youtu.be This looks like it could be either mediocre or horrible.\nBut the fact they released a trailer in early 2020 for the film coming in 2021 is gonna be bad for marketing with how audiences may forget it\nEdit: Dear god the comments, I\'m actually rather intrigued by the premise but the marketing is just subpar, it could end up like The Invisible Man in terms of marketing quality to success overall, I\'m just cautious This actually looks very good I hope I can see it I was looking forward watching this movie this year, but I can wait a bit longer until President\'s Day 2022 weekend.  I wonder how the animators did his arm tentacle muscle movements. It looks enthralling and a cool concept My dad wanted to see this because it\'s like WWE- I was trying to find this trailer after seeing the Sonic movie. And it\'s finally here this looks like it\'s going to be a great one, can\'t wait until this comes out. hopefully ever thing will be back to normal by then & all this sickness will go bye bye waiting for these really cool movies to come out. rumble, encanto, luca + raya and the last dragon. i know they all are going to be worth the money and the time to watch. Monster Hunter: WWE DLC looks dope. It sure going to appease critics and audiences, let’s hope it gets a good rotten tomatoes  score once it comes out. I can’t wait! A WWE film with a song or theme from The Space Jam 1 and 2 soundtrack, Now that\'s a Rumble. I\'m excited for this but also worried.. Its never a good sign when a trailer is released this early on D: This movie actually looks really good I can\'t wait that looks awesome People who watched the old Sonic Movie trailer be like:\n\n1:43 It’s like Digimon meets WWE and that’s awesome Looks like a fun movie. Animation seems to look very good. I\'ll see it. Wayyyyy too early to release a trailer. My best guess is they wanted to pair it with Sonic in theatres but good luck getting those guys to remember this film in a year. I can see this as a movie I would watch. It reminds me of a game. I loved that game. You could play as a monster with different powers and destroy cities. It was amazing. . Then my mom deleted it. I WAS SO SAD. Hearing this voice not come out of a drug addict/alcoholic Horse is weird “So did he eat one?” Hahaha  this looks like a cute movie. The trailer is awesome ️ This movie is a message that we are in the last days. I\'m already looking forward to movie already despite being pushed back to 2022 Can\'t wait for this! ️ Remember people do this for money! Becky and Roman are really killin the game right now the cast is amazing  Less than four months until this (supposedly) comes out. Sometime in the next month we\'ll find out whether this is still on course for it\'s February release and finally gets a second (and hopefully more interesting) trailer at last , or just continues to play the ""hoping for COVID to be gone in 6 months time"" game and is left in the cabinet for another year or something.... I can’t wait for this  You gotta love when they use that music you would hear from a cloudy of meatballs. When I hear that music, I just know what that art style is going to be about. Why do we have to wait until 2022? It should be out this year. I want to see it. Winnie\'s voice actresss, Geraldine Viswanathan, is from Australia. Therefore, Geraldine had to practice a North American accent in order to voice Winnie. I\'m conflicted about this movie\nit\'s made by the studio who owes it\'s existence to Michael Bay\nbut that\'s some damn good animation and manster design WOAH indeed, this is probably gonna be an epic movie Will Arnett’s first Monster character was “The Missing Link” from DREAMWORKS’ MONSTERS VS ALIENS and now he portrayed the voice of his new Monster role So basically mini kaiju fighting? Yeah, I\'m in. Am I the only one who thinks the animation is good? Kinda reminds me of those strange late 2000\'s DreamWorks movies. In all seriousness I like tentacular\'s design The person who plays the heroine is also the girl who played Becky in “The Package” on Netflix. In 2021, FFX makes 20th-anniversary celebration begin and I wish Rumble will get positive just like Fighting with my family along with Main Event 2020 as new era sports theme. I want to watch it along with the Main Event at home to give them a positive reception after watch. When Steve eventually fights Tentacular there is definitely going to be a scene where that shark tail is going to be used against him Moves I wanna see in this film.\nSuplex, V- trigger, drop kick, moonsault, suicide dive, snap dragon suplex, shooting star press, destino, kamigoye and one wanted angle As me being a wrestling fan and a giant monster fan I gotta see this  I\'m going to already be 14 by the time this movie comes out and it\'s still early 2020 This is just what we needed it. A movie about wrestling monsters, so that we can make rule 34 fanarts of them. I\'m very interested. This looks like a good movie! I was so hyped because I expected this to be a league of legend movie about Rumble. I WANNA SEE THIS MOVIE SO BAD I wonder if tentacular will be the bully character ""you don\'t belong here"" guy or be a chill dude who actually wants Steve to participate like a friendly foe Do a sequel of jeepers and creepers (2021) this year I been waiting for my life!\nAnd I can wait to see this trailer When you realise one of the voice actors is from Monsters vs Aliens This could basically be King Kong training to fight Godzilla.\nRemember, COULD, not IS or WILL. Doesn\'t really look like a gripping storyline does it? Probably be ok for a forgettable one time watch Now we know why this trailer came out despite the fact the movie was gonna come in 2021 I’m worried, the idea is brilliant and can give a lot of potential, but some of it looks like it won’t hold up real well OH MY GOSH A NEW MOVIE! that shark dude makes me think of my Special Olympics Swimming nickname: Speed Shark  ️ This movie looks so awesome. Tentacular was my favorite thing from the trailer; he looks so cool. I completely forgot this existed. Feels like this dropped a lot longer ago than it did This is some next level dreamworks animation right there Everyone it\'s ready to rumble!!! The Monster wrestlers are ready for the Monster Mania cant wait to see it The movies concept is actually pretty unique I Can\'t Wait To See This Looks good Holy fuck, I didn\'t know about this movie until now! It\'d be fucking DOPE if there was a Godzilla cameo! :D I can\'t wait to see rumble next year I would watch it  if it comes out I wanna see this movie, I love his character so much  Can\'t wait for 2021. Everyone: Oh look, another Animated movie. It looks interesting enough to watch.\n\nFurries: Time to draw OwO Amanzing can wait 2 see it  I\'m not watching this unless the story is actually about the main character\'s depression and alcoholism. Also, instead of a monster and a wrestler, Will Arnette\'s character is a horse and an actor in Hollywoo. Basically, I want a Bojack horseman movie. Coming soon to a theater near you! I love this The animation looks good but I don\'t know it might be bad let\'s just hope it\'s not the case Me: Mom, can we watch Real Steel?\nMom: We have Real Steel at home \n\nReal Steel at home: man, I hope I can see this in 3D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Monster Wrestling?\nI wonder if Godzilla and his monsters are available to do that. Looks nice  ""How do you make something right when you\'ve made it so wrong you can never go back"" Bojack Horseman i cant wait to see this Those who saying "" lets get ready to rumble"" is boxing. You are wrong! WWE produces its second biggest pay per view after Wrestlemania called the Royal Rumble since 1988 which usually begins with the announcer announcing the exact phrase "" Let\'s get ready to Rumble"". Gotta love the Dirty Dancing lift move at the end  According to the IMDb cast list, Ben Schwartz is in this movie.\n\n$50 says his character is blue Hhmm, Looks silly, but appears to have some classic kaiju influence! Even the shot of the one monster climbing up the rail road, looks similar to Kong\'s first appearance in Kong Skull Island! I might watch that! maybe it could\'ve been a unique story about tentacular being the main character, and how his stardom is getting the best of him. Nobody is thinking of him as a person/monster but instead is thinking of him as a big champion, and maybe he gets stressed that he may not please everyone and that someone else might take the throne and that might be the best because he was always the best. Well, in my opionion, this movie seems very intresting Listen, listen.\nAll nasty internet jokes aside, if you think I\'m not gonna watch this the day it comes out you\'re wrong.\nGiant wrestling monsters? Heck yeah! >:O\nThis is my childhood dream coming true and I am NOT letting the Internet ruin it for me! I\'m not sure how to feel about this, but it\'s kaiju, Terry Crews, John DiMaggio, and Will Arnett in it. So, yeah, I\'m interested. E X C I T E D After rewatching this trailer, this film may have a Japanese anime feel to it. this looks great When will it be realeased,???? in prime or hotsar..plz tell I just saw this trailer in a regal theater and the whole trailer was flickering… as if “rumbling”. No joke. Trippy I WANT KEVIN HART TO VOICE CLIFFORD IN THE LIVE ACTION CLIFFORD MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!! WWE with giant monsters, this is everthing that I ever wanted and I never know!! OMG, did a child write this? This feels very much like the kind of story a school-age kid would write. Why do I instantaneously recognize the starting music from Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Tentacular vs Steve? Now I KNOW this will be an epic movie. I love the concept of Kaiju Wrestling... but isn\'t 2021 kind of a long wait from now? \nI mean WE JUST STARTED 2020!!! I thought I saw this trailer last year but it turns out looks neat really ! After this it need to make a tv show or a 2 movie then a tv show it have so much potential seeing a fat monster and then realizing its played by the guy who played the deppressed alcholic horse man! I can already predict three things about this movie.\n1. The Tentacular guy is going to be revealed to not be as strong as he appears.\n2. The red monster is obviously going to be the next wrestling champion. \n3. Some character is going to make a huge speech about how having monsters wrestle each other is wrong or something. It’s nice to see that Bojack Horseman is starting small as a voice actor though. I would actually see this. A wwe monster wrestling movie where the monsters are massive? Uh yeah heres my money get me front row seats now. Holy gawd this is gonna be epic. Litterally Godzilla, Real Steel, Pokemon, and Monsters. Inc in one movie No one:\nRule34: Let us introduce ourselves. ugh! this concept is very cool. with the world loving big monster fights this is a clever idea that they turned big monster fights into a sport but it looks like it\'s being wasted to be a everyday kids movie. wish they did more work with Steve. Tentaculur is much more interesting I thought for a second he was the main character for a moment. Cant wate for this it sounds amazing i want a second movie trailer Will Arnett for the win ! Am I the only one that things that the art style looks beautiful? Is that the horse from Horsin\' Around? So you took Kaiju Big Battel’s long running concept of monsters facing off in pro wrestling and just tossed in a plucky underdog story? I know why they released the trailer early in 2020 when the release date was 2021, Paramount knew the Coronavirus was coming I like it already, had me at Kaiju wrestling lol Bless animated movies, they are pretty much the only side of Hollywood that keeps delivering stuff that is 100% new.\n\nThey make take inspiration from other stuff, but they are not sequels to other movies, or remakes/reboots, and they are not based on something that already exists like a book, a comic or a show. WWE+ paramount pictures+ monsters+ probably Nickelodeon= this movie Wow the animated remake of Sharktopus looks great! i wanna see it its so cool If humans and monsters become Friends on Pacific Rim Announcer: is there a challenger for tentacular?!\n\nGodzilla: very poor choice of words The fact that a trailer dropped for this movie before Godzilla vs Kong hurts. Doesn\'t seem funny but I like the concept enough to watch it honestly. Finally a original WWE movie that doesn\'t cross over with another properties like Scobby Doo I\'m cautiously excited. Kaiju version of ""Real Steel"" This looks like Real Steel with kaiju.  This is a great high concept and I hope they give it a decent treatment. ^.^ A audição deles são muito boa neh. Pra ouvir uma vozsinha lá longe All Of The Audiences are Gonna See This Movie In 3D. Steve looks like if you took Sully from Monsters Inc, Wreck-It-Ralph, and Bojack Horseman, and grounded them with a blender.\nAlso, this is the second animated kaiju movie to feature Will Arnett. i cant wait for this Paramount execs: So, when should we drop the teaser for our animated movie from next year that\'s obviously not a shameless rip-off of Monsters, Inc., but with wrestling?\n\nParamount CEO: Now. Looks kid friendly which is rare to see nowadays also something original instead of another remake I’m intrigued I saw this trailer in Theaters while watching the #sonicmovie Where do I begin? The CG animation looks fluid, the concept of the movie is clever. But the major problem I have with the trailer is the writing and jokes that looks like it\'ll ruin the film\'s concept. For a movie that\'s set for next January in 2021, it looks like another box office bomb for another film in January. So, my predicted RT score is 10%. If giant monsters fight I call those BEAST WARS!!!!!!! Missed opportunity to have the Rock and John Cena in a movie together. Something tells me Tentacular is going to be the main antagonist. Looks like an Animated version of ""Real steel"" When I heard the piano theme in the trailer. I thought it was another “Cloudy chance of meatballs” I legit saw this as a trailer before the sonic movie when I went to see it. The second I saw this I leaned over to my friend and said ""wait til the furries find this"" The orange monster\'s design looks like it was inspired by Sulley from Monsters Inc. The only difference between them is that Sulley is blue and furry, while Rumble\'s main monster is orange and scaly. This is gonna be big. Roman rings giving his voice to this character good news. ...i am pretty excited to rumbel in theatre  Does anybody else get flash backs to ready to rumble boxing round 2 from the announcer clip? Uh, this was early, this movie is literally coming a year later, this trailer was too early :/ Seeing a trailer for a bad movie is sad yet hilarious.\nSeeing a trailer for a movie with good voice actors and gourgous animation yet with a stale and lazy plot is just plain sad. Hearing Steven A smith is just amazing So after years of being silent Will Arnett finally returns Is it just me or have movies gotten progressively more mind numbing? The blockbuster movie of the year Movie Called rumble.\n\n\nsays famous boxing quote “let’s get ready to rumble”. i\'m not finished with the trailer yet but i know tentacle or somethin will be evil, the famous, heroic-like people are always villains. I saw this trailer when I saw the Sonic the Hedgehog movie it’s kinda weird seeing a trailer for a movie that’s releasing next year It\'d be interesting if the monsters in this movie were originally human but underwent a transformation to become monsters Wowee, can\'t wait to see the Scooby Doo crossover for this one! Paramount, I suggest giving this movie the same-day Paramount+/theatrical release treatment like you did with Paw Patrol and Clifford. Saw the Trailer for this when I saw the Sonic Movie. Looks like its gonna be fun. Giant Kaijus in a wrestling competition. Just release it already. So Kaiju Big Battel is around for over 20 years. Monsters are REAL and Danger can Happen. They are not animated. They are real!! Kinda wish Tentacular was the main character, he seems like a very cool guy. The tiger dude looks so unmotivated. Now with the COVID-19 outbreak, this was unintentionally a smart decision done by Paramount seeing how a ton of movies is going to delayed thanks to this crisis. Dammit, I thought this movie is coming out this year. Guess I\'ll have to wait another 9 months, then. Needs rock, cena and r-truth and Arquette Real steel, Rocky, Creed, and any other fighting movie out there....but with monsters Why are the people are not scared of the giants. So we’re cool with monsters now. Wwe Beast monster rumble time! Yeahhhh! When I first saw the opening sequence of the trailer in theaters I thought it was shark tale 2. This looks good and the advertising is done well. Definitely take my kids to see this looks like it has a strong Male and female leads but no agenda pushing. Definitely watching this I\'m actually finding it pretty difficult to root for our main character.\n\nIt seems like they are trying to go for a ""Lovable jerk"" vibe (Even being voiced by Will arnett) but here I feel like it doesn\'t work. Awesome  First, The Firefighters Tries To Find The Parents To The Kids\nThen, A Sponge Needs To Bring A Tiny Snail Back Home\nNow, A Monster Wants To Become A Wrestler\nWhat’s Next? Us monster lovers are gunna go insane over this movie OMG!!! 2021!?  Can\'t wait to see Saberspark\'s review of this movie. I\'m sure all the kids of 2021 will get the Dirty Dancing reference lol. Still, might be cute though. I\'ll watch it and if it\'s wholesome and kids like it, I\'m for it. The main character is like Godzilla and Kong combined. Well they made a more creative looking sharktopus, this film could of been interesting if it was made by a better studio.  A world where kaijus coexist with humans, but civilize and the famous kaiju fighting become wrestling. This movie probably would of been alright on Netflix, but not in a $30 theater. Bruh I don\'t think ppl will be waiting for this movie they will probably forget it even exists before it comes out and tbh I think I already know the plot it probably gonna be cliche Glad to see that the WWE and Paramount ""borrowing"" the ideas of KAIJU BIG BATTEL So Will Arnet, aka Bojack aka Lego batman is the main character? We also got Terry Crews Stephen A Smith and for us WWE fans (and yes WWE is helping produce this movie) Roman Reigns and Becky Lynch are also gonna be in this movie. Looks like voicing Batman, Surly Squirrel, Slade/Deathstroke, the Scary Vulture, Vlad and Mr. Perkins paid off once again for Will Arnett^^ This is combination between WWE,monster Inc and Kung Fu Panda Boss:We need a paramount about monsters fighting on the battlefield \n\nParamount: hold my beer!! I already know this guy will unlock some power to defeat sharkhentai over here like fire breath or something Paramount Pictures: Lets get ready to Rumble with Sully\nMe: Come on, Monster inc like WWE or Pokemon? Seriously. Rumble would feature new cast including SL (June 29, 2006) and RB (April 3, 1987). This seems like a good concept executed horribly I really thought that orange monster was the villain but I realized he was the main character. Kaiju meets wrestling! I\'m in! LETS GET READY TO RUMBLE!!! Are kids going to get that ""Dirty Dancing\' reference? I want to know who decided that tentacle arms were the way to go Put your starring actors in the titles!  I find it quite bizarre how they\'re already promoting Rumble, a 2021 film, before a film that actually comes out this year like Clifford the Big Red Dog Pretty original and fresh, I\'ll give it that. But why bother make a movie about giants if they move pretty much like a 6 foot dude? Ya know im actually excited to see just how bad this might be Back in the 2020\'s\nI made an animated film that just wasn\'t as good as my depressed horse tv shoooooooooooooow\nThis ain\'t Bojack,\nBojack the Horseman. 00:32 That is sick and wrong, and also kinda cool at the same time. Monster wrestling\n\nGodzilla: Am i joke to you? Make the sharks voice deeper he’s a big Buffy monster who needs to sound tough and not like a wimp So basically, Kaiju wrestling. Not a bad idea. Sharktopus dude looks badass. all i\'m thinking while watching this trailer is ""how can any game devs mess a game version of this film??"" literally about monsters vs monsters... we\'ll wait and see.. I\'ll give some serious positive points for originality. That\'s brilliant Based on a comic book named \'monster on the hill\'. Fur affinity is going to have a blast with this one. This film’s post credits scene: Jumbo Ross: “Have you any sympathy for Tentacular?” Vince Micromanage: “I have no sympathy for Tentacular. He disrespected a time honored tradition, he disrespected the wrestlers that made him a superstar, Tent screwed Tent.” Thats so crazy i had this imagine when i dreamt having wrestle on cgi GIVE US A SONIC 2 TRAILER ALREADY PLLZZZZZZ Can wait until tomorrow to see Me: Mom, Can I Watch Monsters, Inc?\nMom: We Have Monsters, Inc. at Home\nMonsters, Inc. at Home: Can\'t wait for the toys! I can see the fan art already. The cgi on this is next-level ngl This trailer could play before Raya and the Last Dragon when comes out on March 5 I think i may spoil right now but i think its kinda having a chance what im saying\n\n-soo first this movie will be based on WWE but its like with monsters \n-if u take a look at this scence 0:43 you see that tentacular is glowns blue and if u look closely u can see his eyes glowing blue too. I think its somewhere around a special power, (its not glowing) where he gets like stronk. And mb if u look at our monster this red one i think it has a special power too, like burning or berseker mode. But maybe all monster has a special power but they r weaker The second trailer would feature Steve vs Tentacular at Monster Wrestling in the wrestling ring. Roman reigns and Becky lynch will also be lending their voice for this movie  I don\'t know, the character designs and premise seem too generic to me. But I haven\'t seen the film, of course. It could be amazing. Unfortunately, this trailer didn\'t sell me on the concept. Also, why did they think advertising this so early was a good idea? I can barely remember what I just watched. You expect me to remember this a year later?  The most you\'ll get out of me is, ""Oh yeah..."" Thanks for posting this! This has festival vibes here folks I like concept of the movie Casting gag: This isn’t the first time Will Arnett voiced a monster. LET\'S GET READY TO RUMBLLLLLLLE!! Monster wrestling? Isn\'t that just Kaiju Big Battel? Giant, visually-pleasing, manly, hunky monsters, one of which has tentacles and the other of which looks soft and fluffy in addition to a tummy, duking it out. Tell me this isn\'t aimed directly at us furries. Go on. I dare you. You can tell they had a ball animation tentacular. Also, I can already tell the furry fandom is just going to eat this movie up. Paramount: Hey! Check out a trailer for this movie! \nMe: oh cool! When does this come out? \nParamount: 2021! \nMe: *looks at watch Apparently as an animator you can only make movies featuring human characters, unless you want the Internet to complain about how it will appeal to furries. I will watch this next year All I hear is Bojack Horseman when Steve speaks  So I guess I dont really understand this or the choices they\'ve made trying to piece this together. They are going for this whole pokemon monster fights monster thing I get that... but like, why? The humans dont really seem relevant in the movie other than them throwing in this coach girl who seems like a flat, last minute add to make their unwilling main character seem better. We all know monsters inc/university only used monsters and we all loved it, so the girl can go. But, the voice acting all still seems off especially with tentacular and the main character monster. Having a big budget is nice, but its not all about having the richest stars everywhere. Its about who would do best in the role. I dont feel like anyone with experience is making this for anything other than little kids on netflix.  Love it, he looks cute, I wanna cuddle him I hope that Tentacular is a charismatic, good kind of cocky guy instead of another Ripslinger. So Ludo has a wrestling movie now? Cool  This Movie Seems A Lot Like Kung Fu Panda Like At 0:50 Terry Crews plays the shark monster with tentacles. I\'m also glad Will Arnett is acting in something that is not another lego movie or a Reeses peanut butter cup advertisement. Although, i recently dolittle, and in the movie, Arnett played the voice of a rabbit locked up in a jail cell. However he was not credited for his performance, which is not cool, because he did a great job, even though dolittle was not all that great. Monster wrestling ️ ️? Wow   . It\'s Feb 2020, 10 more months for 2021. Why so soon? People will forget about this in a week. Bet you 20 bucks tentacular is gonna be a twist villain Everyone: Perfect for furries.\nMe: FINALLY! A MOVIE FOR ME! Kids would totally get that reference to that movie released 33 years ago. Oooo. This is gonna be a fight to watch It would be nice if they show more monsters going against the champion while the MC is training... probably not going to happen but hey!!.... I am just a comment Seems fun, But god damn they either need better voice changing and effects for tentacular, or they need a whole new voice, because it does NOT fit, along with his character and size. If you like dogs as I do, then you\'re going like a new movie! paramount animation presents JEEPERS AND CREEPERS in spring (2021) But no one realizes that Godzilla sized monsters are fighting in front of people who could get hurt Do we really need Monsters inc. 3? So basically, Pokemon meets Godzilla\n\nAlright, I\'m down with this. Lol cant wait Guys, I heard Netflix has a dark and gritty version of this. It is called Sonnie\'s Edge from Love , Death & Robots. Those are some giant monsters in this movie. They\'re all twice the size of skyscrapers and buildings. First song is Sirius by Alan Parsons. Ive been searching for it since February. There was a 3 second teaser of Steve trying to lift a sign.\nSong in that clip is, AJR - Burn the House down Maui grew up to be a Godzilla-kracken-man. Cool. Seen this while I was watching the sonic movie. I wanna see this lol Took me ages to figure out that the main character has the same voice as Bojack Basically real steel with talking robots  Hey where\'s Godzilla in this lol can\'t wait to see Kong I see BoJack is still trying to find the right path. Well I can\'t wait to see my Twitter feed getting a lot of Tentacular drawings from artists  This film feels like Monsters Inc + that Robot Wrestling film of Hugh Jackman. So...this is like a Kaiju wrestling world? I want this to be my first no or in 2021 The human characters should have also been monsters. Well this looks... generic.  It\'s like ""Mucho Libre"" but with giant monsters.  Ya gotta do more with a concept than just slap a cliche plot line onto it.  Tentacular is more cooler.Could have made him the main monster Its looking like a Rocky style movie.

Rumble should release in 2021. They better put rumble by dusty locane for the outro music Getting big Shark Tale vibes from this for some reason This movie:\nKaiju Big Battle: Am I a joke to you? This is what happens when the kajiu universe meets WWE I expected Tentacular to have a deeper voice I think tentacular should be the main character I have a husband that has a nephew that sounds like tails. Could you please get him in auditions Looks like a okay movie 10 likes say that we\'ll get Godzilla references. Guys\n\n\nthe Sharktopus is voiced by Terry Crews.  Pfft. Dr. Cube wouldn\'t look twice at these monsters. An animated kaiju movie? That’s new. Why is Jolyne Kujo helping Sulley to fight against the fusion of Bruce from Jaws,the Shark from Nemo and the Shark from Sharktale? Thank God this is coming out next year and not in 2020, it would just make this year much worse. This is what happens after godzilla and the other titans decide to co-exist together without causing hell Wow! That movie reminds me of Veggietales Sumo of the Opera. person says lets get ready to rumle\nMe: this is wwe (Groan) I\'m already dreading the disgusting  fan art Winnie\'s pad features the rules written and squares to make check. 1:29 How much you wanna bet that this joke will mean something in the final fight of the film?

Why is ""I\'ve Had the Time of My Life"" a key higher in this trailer?  (1:21) 1:33 King K. Rool in Smash Ultimate\'s Elite Smash Alguém sabe o nome dessa música do início ???

SOOOOO... unnatural.... its not even an echo... and theres not even a pre-fight... whoever is editing and voicing this character needs to be fired... for the trailer alone. Wonder Park Reminds Me Of Disneyland\nRumble Reminds Me Of Monsters, Inc. Soooooo AWSOME!!!!!!!!. One Of The Previews When I Saw The Sonic Movie “He’s coming!” When does the movie come out No one:\nNot a single soul:\nyoutube ads: pacific rim \nwwe Streaming December 15 on Paramount+ WWE: Can We Fight Each Other At The WrestleMania?\n\nMonsters, Inc.: Am I Joke To You? Ah sweat this is like #kaiju #kaijubigbattel where’s Dusto bunny or the evil dr cube!!! Sadly, I wanna see this. Rumble 2021 from Paramount Animation Nickelodeon movies   Awesome So this movie will come in 2021. So they should have released the trailer in July or August Monsters Inc: Smackdown Let\'s get ready to rumble It\'s like a cartoon version of real steel 0:48 it\'s this Stephen A Smith\'s voice im hearing? Hello hola Paramount espero con ansias Godzilla vs Kong Sonic el erizo fue una buena película yes I want to see this So is basically a kind of rewstrilng with big monsters and humans training them and enjoying the fights, it sounds creative thou, but... how does this world actually works ? To all you furry haters, how does it affect your life that we want to be furries and draw characters we see? I mean really, you insult us yet we aren\'t even doing anything to you. Bunch of immature people who dont know what  furries are really like. FYI they\'re not furries. So let me get this straight, basically, monsters Inc entered the human world, made peace between mosnters and humans, and established their own wrestling company?......... Bojack become a monster ! 1:43 YOUR nightmare, HER dream come true. It\'s like a cartoon version of real steel Bojackk horseman gott me  It\'s like a cartoon version of real steel So it’s basically your typical cliche underdog story where it’s WWE meets Monsters Inc. Looks interesting but why did i get a trailer if this when watching the sonic movie before the trailer got uploaded to youtube and why is thus getting shown off proboly over a year before release No ones talking about the fact that this trailer is insane early. 2021? It’s only March. Paul heyman looking real cute tho This is going to take a long time Am I the only one who thinks tentacular  will be the villain of the movie? 2021???\n\n\nnot that im gonna see it lol 0:56 the view from halfway down. Stephen A Smith and Terry Crew?? Bro I’m hyped lessgo man the only joke this movie has apparently is fat jokes... very cool... I don\'t get why kids movies feel the need to include such mean spirited humor only when it\'s pointed towards fat people. These jokes haven\'t been funny since fucking Nicole Arbour was a thing... Definitely thought this was a ""Street Sharks"" Movie lol! With all the reboot fever going around why not, right? Wake me up when it goes to Netflix. Did you see this trailer in front of Sonic the Hedgehog? Since Sonic the Hedgehog movie was a success, I guess this movie would do the same as well… Rumble Coming early 2022?! Sooo, Real Steel. But furries. They really got Stephen A smith in this Why are you delaying in the announcement of Upcoming TF movies. I know paramount, you had faced some bad situation in 2017 but you have to recovered and start with Original G1 source. You should be motivated and one guy that do this is Optimus Never give up..And show to rest to of world that TF is king. Marvel Fans are always get 2 new movies in every year. But TF fans are not getting anything( 2019-20 ).. Please try to release any TF movie in 2021.. My best wishes to you and TF  Rule 34 is already having a field day with this movie Jeepers and creepers (2021) coming soon to a theater near you! Would Godzilla be the Rock or Undertaker in this universe This movie should just skip theaters for Paramount+ If they really wanted to be successful... why are they releasing it after another monster (or more like kaiju) related movie that has not one but two popular well known monsters of cinema? LLS(Lemuel’s Lair Studios): I want to see the PAW Patrol: The Movie Official Trailer. It\'s like if Kung Fu Panda and Monsters Inc had a wrestling baby in the discount dvd bargain-bin at Wal-Mart The challenger in training looks like a red version of Sulley.   With the voice of Wreck-It Ralph. Why did it say real 3D? What’s fake 3D Wow 2021 for this movie to release 1:25 my reaction to the trailer That music at the start is from cloudy with a chance of meatballs What I don’t get is \n\n0:21 as u can see he doesn’t seem that big in this scene This is gonna be better :D giant bojack horseman Wow they even change the title to 2021 to 2022 just wow I mean I’m surprised it got delayed with just this but :/ ok Was not expecting the tentacle arms? Kaiju animated film. All I\'m seeing is Rocky, but with wrestling, monsters and animation. so awsome movie to get reday far 2021#rumblemovie WWE for furries. The film reminds me Monster Truck Mater with wrestling elements. 0:25 \nWho else thought the background music was Radioactive- Imagine Dragons and was waiting for it to say “I’m wakin up”? Honestly this just looks like another ugly dolls/emoji movie\n\nJust some B movie story with some bs message that entertains children and dose nothing for everyone else The end of the movie would feature fireworks and sky is all night. Umm tentacular is huge Steve is small look at 0:32 and 1:02 Isn\'t this similar to Godzilla but in a cartoon and the Titans can talk? XD Cool art style, But this is probably a movie i am not so excited for, But i may change my mind and i remember seeing this before sonic. the shark reminds me of boog All I know is that Stephen A must say “That’s Blasphemy!” In this movie. Or else I ain’t seeing it Back in the 90’s I was in a very famous TV show 1:45 \n""2021""\nLIES!!! ALL LIES!!! I think this will be like rocky. Or if you haven\'t watched rocky but played on the nes myke Tyson punch out. Wrestling could actually do a great animated movie but instead it\'s like monsters inc but more satanic Man the voice is so out of place. Can you imagine if there\'s a reference to Power Rangers? But it looks like the rumble of WWE ive watched it on:\n\n""WATCHDAD.COM""\n\nits so great that it exists in 2020.. From The Creators Of a Series of Unfortunate Events and The Spiderwick Chronicles & The Author Of The Book of Life This movie is going to release in may 2021 0:05 Gallaxhar Clones Music You should got the idea in 2019 and made it in 2020 Hooooooo boy, here we go. What happened to this movie What? 2021 release damn. Those animator is working a lot 0:37 ""Yee"" i wasn\'t going to say it but, ""yeah, that\'s gonna be a hard NO for me."" 1:24 0:05 this beat is familiar it is from the movie ""cloudy with a chance of meat balls in the Minute 45 :57"" i am being serios go watch the movie ⮚ Rumble (2021) f\'u""l\'l M\'o\'V\'i""E ⮘\n»» indahhmovie.blogspot.com/tt8337158/inf.html Trailer 2 Please! This movie is like Monsters Inc and WWE that has been put into a blender to make this film. Interesting ⮚ Rumble (2021) f\'u""l\'l M\'o\'V\'i""E ⮘\n»» indahhmovie.blogspot.com/tt8337158/inf.html I want Macho Monster Randy Savage Thumbs down for making me think they were making a new Ready 2 Tumble boxing game. I heard the intro and started doing Afro Thunders Bruce lee hops and then my heart broke. Woooooooa! It will take to long in 2021 I wish the movie is in 2020 Rumble is coming very soon Why he looks like James P. Sullivan, but different colors. And bit different look. 0:16 me too  I am waiting for wonderpark 2 0:13 Let’s get ready to rumble Hope this film ain’t just about the girl and his relationship with the girl… Is they release this trailer, is that means we\'re going to see  mlp g5 movie trailer also, Sometimes in years or months? I relly want to Watchthat when it comes out I like jeepers and creepers from paramount titles studios so maybe this year in 2021, can you make a new movie for kids? jeepers  is the one with white fur, a blue hat, a blue pants, with black shoes and red sweater. And creepers with Brown fur, a white shirt and black pants and shoes and how a\nBlack hat. And more dog characters I love. They look like dog team but they were really dog cartoons. So if you remember the short films in (1960) This is WWE Studios first animated feature film Steve\'s voice looks like Batman from The LEGO Movie and Slade from Teen Titans Go! To The Movies. This movie: *exists*\nWWE: I\'m about to end this man\'s whole career. If there’s a big rock monster named the rock WHO is also played by THE ROCK you can have my money now. Wasn\'t this supposed to be a WWE movie? What day is the second trailer coming from Rumble? (2021) This Trailer for Godzilla vs. Kong looks Weird! when is this movie coming out ffs Sounded like Kronk voiced of Patrick Warburton! Hold up why is there a trailer for a movie coming out next year? Wait... Didn\'t know Bojack Horsemen is in this movie!! Next year, paramount pictures will be presenting a new movie! I\'ll be a dog movie. It\'s called jeepers and creepers! Coming soon to a theater near you! Sorry, but is no one gonna jump on the strength and endurance joke at 1:15 . 0:46 is that Stephen a smith coz it sounds exactly like him Rumble movie good movie others: ""furry wwe""\nme: KAIJU WRESTLING FUCK YEAH 0:17, 0:19-0:27 Tentacular reminds me of Sharktupus, but cooler Hey, the orange monster kinda sounds like the horse from Horsin’ Around Hoo boy. Bara fans are gonna cream their pants left and right over this movie. In 1 year this is it cloudy with a chance of meatballs vibes on the first song At first I thought this was a new Monsters Inc. i like this movie A Paramount Picture 2020 I remember seeing this trailer before watching the Sonic movie because of the ads oh shit almost forgot about this lmao So this is kinda like How To Train Your Dragon meets Monsters Inc meets Kung Fu Panda..... yeeahh...so ""original"".... Another question, the film would feature Steve\'s fan with tattoo body of Steve. In 2021! Thats next year! This looks like WWE trying to get into the movie craze and making this movie was probably just a corporate cash-grab. Okay, so the description says this movie is releasing in in February 2022, but the website says it\'s coming this month, sooooo, which is it?!\n\nAlso, hi, Fishdad. Didn\'t expect you to be here. Am I the only one who noticed that that’s Stephen A. Smith’s voice at 0:39? Paramount animation: JEEPERS AND CREEPERS in spring (2021) \nYour gonna to miss the old famous studios movie next year! Wow a movie about Kaiju wrestling sweet Why release the trailer now if it’s coming out next year? He looks like Sully from monsters inc but in red So I am the only person watching this in 2021 ?? This movie literally had one trailer then dipped for a year The red guy must be like another new wreck it ralph guy Here is the nerd in me hoping this is good. The orange one looks like he could be related to sulley.....two different universes, I know Tentacular needs a new voice actor. His current one reminds me of the donkey from Shrek. This looks great save for the voice on the blue monster. It doesn\'t feel right. Does not feel like it matches So it\'s pretty much a combination of godzilla and WWE The only thing i found interesting really is the facial expressions. Except for that ginger kid, in the blue shirt.\n\n\nA lot of you are anti-furries apparently. So what if this was made by furries or something? Let people be who they wanna be and let people be who they wanna be. Most of them aren’t even hurting anyone! There’s only a minor group of people in the furry community who do bad things you guys are thinking of, and you’re stereotyping all of us because of it! It’s just like Godzilla and the kaijus Well this looks silly. Is it just me or does this monster sound a lot like bojack horseman Is Stephan A Smith really in this? I love the tattoo guy Nice Rumble. Why couldn’t they release this trailer when it was december You don’t need to watch this movie. I can tell you what will happen already. So the big hero monster will be defeated in the end by the once weak monster who got trained by a ‘girl’ (of course we should not forget to force the feminazi agenda down viewers’ throats) and finally be the champion.  0:25 for me the voice doesn\'t sound like the character design 0:04\nmusic theme  An animated version of Pacific Rim Spoiler: that red monster is going to beat that shark octopus monster 2022 thats a long way HAHAHA Is nobody going to question how it says that its coming in february 18 2022 even though its actually coming in 2021 ;-;? Makes us wait till January 2021 during feb 2020 Is it me or is this sound track 0:05 is from Cloudy with a chance of meat balls? I think the name of the movie should be monster rumble. Jeepers and creepers (2021) - official trailer - paramount pictures. You remember. Two comedy characters Jeepers is a tall dog and creepers is a short dog. I hope the bad of this movie is making it good Monsters Inc, Shark Tales vibezzzz, and Pokemon... #Paramountpictures #Jeepersandcreepers  in 2021! When this release? Furry WWE...\nI mean- it can’t be THAT bad, right? Right? A chubby monster vs Tentacle  shark. I know where it\'s going. 1:25 Yeah that’s gonna be a hard known for me Remember this is the company that made sonic. This might be another we studio film but instead of WWE is WMW world monster wrestling OMGGGGG YAYYYYY I am only here to hear Becky’s voice! You basically made a movie about wrestling furrys\n\n\nPrepare yourself for some artwork Is this movie based on a graphic novel or something? So, kaiju movies + Rocky + WWE?\n\nSIGN ME IN Monsters Inc Meets WWE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie is coming out on my birthday They changed it to next year. Sonic send me here. Also who doesn\'t love giant monster battles!?! Don\'t forget godzilla vs kong is comming out guys! Monsters Inc. but it’s WWE This seems like one of those movies that you see in those ""Top 10 Cancelled Animated Movies"" Youtube Videos. Hmmmm didn\'t show a release date at all.... unlike every single other Paramount movie Does anyone know the name of the music at the beginning? just got pushed to 2022. Biiig oof lol What if drew mcintyre was in this movie Oh God LMAO  I feel like this was inspired by Pokemon SWSH\'s Dynamax Battles cuz yknow, giant pokemon battles The release date of rumble is february 9 2022 there you have it i spoiled the release day Pokémon + WWE + Steel Reel = Rumble.  Monsters vs aliens meets rocky Balboa trilogy Dear Paramount animation, do you remember famous studios cartoons like from the 60\'s like Jeepers and creepers Directed by Eddie lawrence and SEYMOUR knetiel and voices by Jack Mercer and Eddie lawrence? Then you\'re welcome to a new movie! Is called JEEPERS AND CREEPERS (2021) you remember these two dog characters. Jeepers is a tall  white dog and creepers is a short Brown dog. Because I know you make such good paramount animation movies. But I I\'ll I want is a movie for kids and adults  to watch during the  covid19 and I wanted so badly in my life! So this time make a trailer with sketch pencils and color more characters. Let me know you a chance of it now. Jeepers and creepers official trailer paramount pictures. And for the cage match; Godzilla versus King Kong. Roman Reigns is actually in this. And WWE Studios are producing it. Dont tell me, its ""Monster inc"" gen right So this is why they didn’t make a Pixar Direct-To-Video sequel. I like the sonic movie it’s so funny I’ll watch it, but 2021?? Hey, isn’t that the horse from Horsin’ around? Ths look cool  This is Sulley now. This trailer came out way too early I like rumble cool! I’ll see it for Godzilla me-mom can we watch this?\nmom-no i don\'t really like it..\nme-yeah me neither. i just wanted to watch something xD..\nmom-okay.. looks like yet another campy kids movie that knows itll make an easy profit if it if they make something loud and colorful for 80 minutes\nim not saying thats whats going to happen for sure (i felt the same way about spies in disguise and i was pleasantly surprised when i actually watched it) but i think its best to avoid this movie when it comes out Why aren\'t they voiced by WWE fighters Oh no it\'s coming in 2021 I thought it\'s 2020 What if Tentacular had a twin sister named Jasmine? I just noticed the announcer is Stephen A Smith. I smell a Godzilla reference somewhere in this film 00:57 Sad man. That is just SAD. 2021? This looks finished why a whole year OwO time to grab my pen! YOU KILLED ALL MY KINGS.....UNIVERSE HAS NO ENTERTAINMENT FOR THIS.....  . THE AFTERLIFE AWAITS MY ENEMIES..... The orange one is gonna challenge him. The blue one will be winning the first few rounds and then somehow this orange one will beat him up and end up winning. Pretty obvious and and I won\'t waste my time watching this movie The Monsters life after they move from Monstropolis to human world.\n\n\nOops sorry it\'s different franchise Why announce a movie that is not coming out until next year despite 2020 is still 2 months in the year boy: did he eat one \nSteve: how dare you \nSteve eats the boy Godzilla would beat all of them in one round Gee I sure hope this movie f l o p s 0:26 if Godzilla and kraken and a shark had a baby and this is the result\nEdited: let me rephrase it’s like if Godzilla and Sharktopus has a baby and tentacular is the result Hey, is the guy who voiced Rumble the Horse from Horsin’ around? i just know where that shark man is heading on the internet Noticed how They used the same soundtrack as space jam Turns out the godzilla vs kong trailer did happen, huh? Do you remember the short films from early 60\' s ? Do like dog cartoons?  then it is time you try a new movie! jeepers and creepers from paramount cartoon studios. Underdog story with fat jokes aplenty? Well, I guess it worked in Kung Fu Panda, but here, I remain to be convinced. 2021, seriously? It\'s still early 2020 bruuuuuuuh Complete and Greeley - Now or Never (opening song) Anybody  - that starting music is from Death note ? Am i right ️ 0:39 Does anyone know what that music is called??? 1:45 Might as well replace that 1 with another 2 All the furries be flocking to see this in theaters This new doom eternal trailer looking different OMG, EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED \n------THE CUTE----------------------GIRLS. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BEST GIRL FOR SEXO  https://vk.sv/4Wa1Wq?HOT_BABES  who else saw this while watching the sonic movie Rumble 2022 push it back to 2020 because there wont be a 2021 I cannot wait for all of this movies sequels. Especially Rumble 4 where Tentucular is killed by a communist. The year (2021): *exists*\nMe: YOU WHAT?!?! This movie will release next year January 2021. So this is the monster version of Rocky? When godzilla decides to beat humanity at there own game: Not bad, but don\'t is the best...\n\n8/10 The real question -\nHow does he shit and piss? Well, that sounds like Pokémon with a few extra Steps These monsters look daddy It\'s like Kong fu panda I think Godzilla should be in the movie Does someone knows the song that plays at 0:38? No one understands that this is a riff on giant monster fight movies? It\'s pretty obvious, I\'m seeing alot of people saying Pokemon, smh. Ignorant. They shouldv\'e added an effect or deepened Terry Crews voice for this role, \n\nWay too high pitched for a 50 foot monster... In this new box office film, hollywood attempts to entice furries with wrestling anthros. And succeeds apparently. Basically Shrek and Kung Fu Panda This is the animated and kid friendly version of godzilla vs kong: So this is the kid version of reel steel but mix with Godzilla vs. Kong So yall just gonna advertise a movie that\'s nowhere near done? Red furless Sully fighting a shark with tentacles.\nParamount animation everybody fun stuff, I got something different 2021\n\nBruv, it’s only february. BRUH 2022 I TOUGHT IT WAS 2021 We all know Roman reigns is the only person to beat him Is that the Home Depot theme song at the beginning Лига монстров (2021) Me: Never been a champion my tentative* dur * . \nMy fennkin: Ugh why anyone want watch this they’ll be idiot... except for piplup I respect her being watching with her being cool. But every else is… who else would ask for this I Cant tell if didn’t know if it intrigues piplup since it feels like Teen titans go mixed with Johnny test but like I said i’ll only respect Piplup for wanting and/or liking this movie  Jeepers and creepers (2021) - official trailer - paramount pictures. You remember,  Jeepers is a tall dog and creepers is a short dog. I think I watched Monsters Inc 2.... The anime looks good but the blue monster voice doesn’t fit in King gedora enter the ring\nAll other monsters: Oh Neptune Tamatoa\'s long lost cousin. look so cool but...the story plot is like Cars? 0:26 he just said E right there Honestly, i thought this is space jam 2 bcuz of that song Did anyone notice Becky lynch voice. btw Roman and Becky are in the Movie  Please coming 2020 I can here the bara furry artist maniacally laughing Am i the only one that thinks that tentacular is gonna be a cheater or a guy in a robot suit? last year in the 1960, people saw this cartoon title called paramount presents jeepers and creepers! jeepers is a tall dog and creepers is a short dog. There  were later redesign as humans. There were just close as friends to the end. So if you can make a trailer of jeepers and creepers 2021 I would love Your movies. But is it has to be a sketch movie just for kids. What about bruce buffers Saying IT\'S TIME!!! What\'s the name of the song playing in the beginning? you should make tentangular the bad guy and only lied and did something only for fame make a trailer of Jeepers and creepers PARAMOUNT first new movie in 2021! Coming soon to a theater near you!!!!!!! I thought this was a nickelodeon movie Steve is so handsome ya se tardaron con el tráiler siguiente no manchen Ok let’s all be honest. This movie is gonna make alot of NSFW shit. Its like pokemon dynamax This is Bojack by the way...\nHorseman Isn\'t this just a pg version of that episode of Love, Death, and Robots? This is just rocky the original first film What\'s the song that plays at the very beginning? Godzilla can blow tens head of ,gigans chainsaw  cuts his tentacles and head off, ghedorah flings him to the sun. I love will arnett Tentacular: exists\nSharktopus: Am I a joke to you? This is definitely someone’s fetish fuel.. I feel this is going be the worst (animated) movie of 2021\nEdit: Oh now it\'s 2022 Rumble (2021) - Final Trailer - Paramount Pictures\n5 de nov. de 2020 ngl Tentacular is pretty sick That monster lady is cute though ngl. i like the movie rumble Fun fact: WWE has never produced a good film. Is that Terry Crews? Remember baby shark ..\nThis him now... feel old yet? Isn\'t that the horse from horsing around? this is a film inspired by too monsters. Hasn\'t even came out yet and the damn furries already has dirty art of the characters. Or Monsters League how about. It’ll be so satisfying to watch this movie flop So is the wrestling a shoot or a work???? You know the macro tentacle Shark is going to go crazy and try to eat people right? Remember Sharktopus well guess what this is a new movie of Sharktopus coming out we just don\'t know When I heard that music in the beginning I thought Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs \nSo why did I get this Pacific rim x monsters inc This Tyson fury v Deontay Wilder Btec version So this is the unknown. Rumbles in the night What day is this movie in cinemas This is ripping off old movies like Real Steel and Dirty Dancing!! If I was Roger Ebert, and if this doesn’t turn out like how Megamind was, it’s a total thumbs down for sure!! Great, you\'ve just started the chain reaction. Whooy is this taking so long to make? Next year jeepers and creepers (2021) because this is my idea!  Why did you guys release the trailer so early wowwww Synopsis: Monster wants 2 b a wrestler but is not fit, so a trainer come and train him 2 b a professional wrestler. But uh-oh, there iz bad guy and he be really good at wrestling, but somehow monster manages 2 beat bad guy and they liv hapilly everer afte.   \nThere, now you don\'t have to watch the movie. oh my god, thats hot! Lol i seen this trailer when i went see sonic the movie and they showed it to us even tho it was supposed to be release the 26 febrary this came up when i searched for stephen a smith HEY! ISN\'T THAT THE HORSE FROM HORSING AROUND?! GIVE ME GODZILLA INSTEAD OF STEVE Love Roman Reigns I am watching this trailer because of becky lynch I have a felling that guy that has tentacular on his body at the end is then gonna have Steve on his body The song that played in the beginning I’ve heard it in a movie but idk which one it really old Made by the same studio that brought you Sonic the Hedgehog 11 months for this? 2022 la pelicula polandballs movie loca AVENTURA\npaises de presentancion\nArmeniaball\nYugoslaviaball wonder Wait, do I hear Stephen A. Smith? I can still kinda hear BoJack Wait why 2020 they already have voice\'s ""Mom can we have Godzilla?""\n\n""We have Godzilla at home"" This movie doesn’t look half bad, sure it has a predictable story and characters, but the idea of giant monster wrestling is a cool idea that reminds me of Godzilla. I’m intrigued to see what this movie holds Rumble movie: exists\n\nGodzilla: ”Huh, look at that. Oh well, looks like a usual kid’s movie plot.” Rumble has kind of become the ""forgotten"" upcoming animated movie. Between the ongoing delays due to the pandemic, and the lack of news on the movie since the first trailer to maintain public interest (along with the overly ""safe"", run of the mill-looking plot despite the movie having a promising concept) , this has certainly faded into obscurity. I\'m guessing sometime within the next couple of months we find out whether we finally get a new trailer for Rumble, or it gets delayed yet again and left in the vault until 2023 or something - I\'m leaning towards the latter. But if the movie\'s completed by now, they really should make this direct to streaming instead of continuing to delay the release 6 months to a year at a time thinking everything will be all better in a few months time (when it\'ll most likely be 10 times  The animation looks really cool, and I like the character designs a lot. But the plot itself seems good, just good. Doesn’t seem like it’ll stand out too much, but it’s sorta creative .^. What they should have done is that made Tentacular the underdog, or made him the main character. I can already tell he has way WAY more personality. Lets be honest, the design of this shark monster looks really cool I believe that this is the second time Will Arnett has voiced a monster in an animated film. The first time is when he voiced the Missing Link in Monsters vs. Aliens . Rumble: exists\n\nGodzilla: ""Now this is a total ripoff, even for us."" This is based on the graphic novel ""Monster on the hill"" by Rob Harrell. Having seen the novel, am I the only one who thinks Tentacular might still be a good guy? After all, the novel IS a nuanced adaptation of the traditional loser-to-hero underdog story, as the wimpy hero and the confident, beloved monster are close friends, and the former finds his worth in combating a greater threat to humans and monsters. Let\'s just hope this is faithful to its concept and source material and doesn\'t go through the motions of being just another predictable underdog story (not only would the latter make it very bland and predictable, but it would leave the movie with a plethora of missed opportunities.) Child: ""Did he Eat One?""\nEveryone: [Laughs]\nChild: ""Excuse me w h a t-"" Everything except the obvious plot is good. The character design of tentacular is what really struck me because it looked so unique and cool while fitting perfectly into the visuals, and for those arguing about his voice not sounding like a jocks, aren\'t you getting tired if characters like him having the same predictable type of voice? Besides, I think it fits in well with him. The animation and look of the movie is amazing but the plot...ugh, the obvious plot “Mom can I go hang out with Prince Sidon?”\n\n“You have Prince Sidon at home.” A kaiju wrestling movie. I’ve officially seen everything. The only timeline where Godzilla is a wrestling legend. Y’all don’t realize,this is the real steel sequel we have been waiting for Isn\'t that the horse from Horsin Around? \n\nSeriously tho, its nice to see Will Arnett Getting the attention he deserves, such a good voice Should’ve made tentacular the main character, he’s so much cooler ""Remember baby shark""\n""This is him now""\n""Feel old yet?"" Honestly this movie looks great and promising “-RUNNNN ITS GODZILLA\n-It looks like Godzilla but due to international copyright laws, it’s not\n-STILL WE SHOULD RUN LIKE IT IS GODZILLA\n-though it isn’t” Imagine being called the ultimate monster and being able to walk down a street without destroying anything. laughs in Godzilla I\'ll help you out so you dont have to waste money on this film the orange guy starts of terrible will probably go through some sort of intense humiliation (probably involving the tentacle guy) the orange guy will find some sort of \'purpose\' and have a huge training montage where he gets super ripped and skilled, the final climax will start the fight will begin evenly but the tentacle guy will start to win, threaten or gloat at the orange guy  there will be a close up zoom shot of the orange guys face looking distraught but then it will harden he\'ll get really angry the fight will carry on and the orange guy wins everyone lives happily ever after. There you go that\'s my prediction I might be wrong but I doubt it these movie are just getting worse. Basically the underdog is the good guy and tentacular is the bad guy who cheats at the end and everyone finds out and hates him I just hope this opens the door to other animated Kaiju films. I\'m kind of disappointed that tentacular isn\'t the main character here... Rumble trailer: exists\n\nRule 34 artists 0.00001 seconds after its release: Oh yeah...its drawing time I’m happy to see bojack is still getting roles, the horny unicorn really did wonders for his revival!! ""Mom, can we have Sidon?""\n\n""No, he have Prince Sidon at home."" i\'m so happy that bojack managed to find a job as a voice actor after getting out of prison Man, I can\'t believe I have to wait a whole year for this. I honestly don\'t care who the main character is I just want to see this movie for the enjoyment Why did I think the shark was going to be voiced by the rock and the other monster voiced by jack black. when I saw this at the theaters I was like ""what the hell is this?!""\nBy the time the trailer ended, I could hear people say whispering ""this movie is gonna fail so badly"" “There no champion out there who can beat Tentaculars”\n“Its there a challenger out there”\n\nGodzilla: Yare Yare Daze Movies today still doing their best to turn every generation of kids into furries. The shark has the power of oldspice on his side, he\'s too powerful!!! Can\'t wait till this movie comes out it looks awesome can\'t wait. “Remember real steel?” “Yeah?” “That with monsters” Less than 3 months to go. We\'ve got to be getting close to a second trailer now, surely! the problem with this movie is that this story was already told like 100 times, and changing only the visual aspect will not really make something new The animation on the first monsters amazing like damn that must’ve taken a long time to animate I\'m so excited for this animation movie , I love the concept so much, we got robots with real steel , now we got monsters  please let there be godzilla as cameo too Just watch, the movies gonna drag on and in the end Steve will wrestle tentacular and tentacular will seem like he will win but then steve will get that cliche ""emotional strength"" and end up winning and happy ending happy ending yipeeee ""Mom can i watch Godzilla vs Kong?""\n\n""No, you have Godzilla vs Kong at home"" ""will you watch the movie?""\n*Yes, for sure!\n*I\'m not completely sure yet.\n*Maybe with my friends. Thus movie feels about 20 years too late. This movie is coming next year! I can\'t wait! I hope every single day that it will be on Netflix This is looks like something that I\'d expect to see in a bargain bin at Walmart, not a feature length film that\'s going to be in theater wtf? I wonder if they are gonna try to 1 up the thing they did with the sonic movie where they listen to the people by fixing a character\'s appearance. Only this time the main protagonist and antagonist simply switch places. Wow, tentacular is actually super duper cool, I love that he\'s way awesome as a real wrestler, and then he started to be famous, in the wrestling ring, how dope is he..., Like the big dude right there! maybe it could\'ve been a unique story about tentacular being the main character, and how his stardom is getting the best of him. Nobody is thinking of him as a person/monster but instead is thinking of him as a big champion, and maybe he gets stressed that he may not please everyone and that someone else might take the throne and that might be the best because he was always the best. Monsters Inc. but everyone’s John Cena Me:""Bojack Horseman is that you?""\nEveryone else: ""Just watch the trailer and stop making references with the  voice actor"" Oh cool!!!! They finally released this trailer so now I dont have to buy a ticket to the sonic movie everyday to watch it!! I\'ve got the feeling this is going to present the typical plot of the loser that becomes stronger but in the end is going to lose against the champion. The moral will be that the most important thing is to participate.\n\nThose plots suck from the very beginning ""Strength and endurance...""\nI\'m dead I like the thought of giant monsters being boxers and fighting, but the overweight underdog cliché is why people watch kung fu panda. If the shark was the main character and went through his own good guy story it would be great. But he\'s gonna be made the bad guy, and the overweight loser will be the champion or whatever. Man that shit is trash, played out in better ways, and old. At least make the main character look cool or change to match the main bad guy. Huh, the orange monster is pretty uninspired, design wise.....it\'s literally just an orange version of Sully, from monsters Inc. This looks very promising! I’m excited for this! End credits scene prediction:\n\nThat one red monster(sorry forgot the name): becomes champion\nEveryone else: cheering Oh yes, a new year, a new me!\n*shows 2021 movie\nMe also: ""DANG IT, ANOTHER YEAR."" Considering they got a year to make this movie, I\'ll give this a solid \'maybe watch.\' I need to see more personality from every main character before I make a proper judgement call. All jokes aside the animation of the shark guy\'s movements are pretty cool looking. The character designs are so dope! It looks like a lot of fun am i the only one that would prefer the shark as the main character? Looks like Sully got a dye job and started taking steroids. 0:46 \n\nReporter: is there a challenger out there, with the hunker, the drop, the discipline to become the next champion ""I GOT YOUR WHOLE LIFE STORY TATTOOED ON MY BODY!""\n\n\nTentacular ""yeah."" I love this movie already because Bojack Horseman will be in it. The producers won my ticket with that decision. This actually looks interesting. And I honestly think the shark dude looks really cool. Lmao people are expecting this movie to be trash, I completely agree  2020: Spongebob: Sponge on the Run\n2021: John Cena x Monsters Inc. Ok. I am a furry and now I feel inspired to make my own Monster wrestler. This reminds me so much of my childhood! Lots of hugs for the big monsters! This actually looks pretty cool lol. Love me some monsters. I burst out laughing when the little kid said ""did he eat a monster"" like that would be weird though the weird part of the internet is gonna have a field day with these designs. 1:33 if this is how Steve finishes tentacular I hope they include the music The main character is so bland and uninteresting\nI\'m rooting for tentacular People say that Rule 34 Artists are going to have a field day with this. and the year 2020 ended up so quickly... I watched this trailer today in cinema and was crying when he said "" did he eat one ""  This is so cool I can’t  wait for it to come out I’m so excited for this movie Despite this movie coming out in 2021, I feel like it’s still going to get overshadowed by the Sonic movie. Paramount did an amazing job with that movie and because of that it might be hard to top This actually looks cool and fun 0:42 that part looks cool tho ""Steve might not look like much, but there is a champion monster inside of him.""\n""Did he eat one?""\nLittle kid\'s a savage! Gotta be honest, using the word ""rumble"" as it relates to giant monster combat probably wasn\'t the best idea due to a certain manga. I think his voice needs an echo when he\'s in the stadium, but the movie looks good. 1:14 Lol. Also Tentacular looks genuinely, spectacular. When I heard the opening music for the trailer I thought about cloudy with a Chance of meatballs. I was so excited for a minute.... until The biggest cash grab in history\ncheap humor\neasy to know what the ending is gonna be\nHe’ll be losing then he will realize some lesson and win the end this actually honestly looks interesting This honestly seems like a lot of fun to watch 0:41 that part Was soo cool TENTACULAR This is basically Sullivan\'s big brother, but on tiger and dragon steroids. fixing that movie:\nTentacular its now the main character then he lost a round vs some new monster and he need to train more I didn\'t think there would be GIANT mansters in this movie Looks awesome, hope it has some good jokes once in a while Therapist: ""Don\'t worry buff shark isn\'t real he can\'t hurt you.""\n\nThis: The Tentaclaur looks pretty badass This.....looks pretty good.....I might watch this and genuinely find this enjoyable 1:07 missed opportunity. I would’ve said “hell yeah he never stood a chance” The design of TENTACULAR is so crazy and cool, good imagination by part of creator. Another yet to be forgotten classic Kid: I want to go see Godzilla vs. Kong\nMom: We have Godzilla vs. Kong at home\nGodzilla vs. Kong at home: Without even watching the trailer I already know a wrestler is in this For a wild second there I thought they were doing a Street Sharks movie; LOVED that as a kid! i love how the main theme is literally from another movie Oh boy, there\'s gonna be some art, I can already see it. Somebody looked at Sonnie\'s Edge from Love, Death, And Robots and decided to make a kid\'s film out of it 1:01 ""Did he eat one?""\nThe kid\'s the only one who wasn\'t laughing so it was a serious question \nWhat if the kid was actually a r34 vore artist I would love to see this movie  It’s another one of those movies where we tag along a character’s journey to be the best at something and beat the person who is currently the best at it... This made me feel excited I feel like Godzilla would be the perfect challenger,who can defeat both these guys with one arm tied behind his back...or spikes Saberspark:\n""Aw shit, here we go again."" For anyone who wants it, the song at the beginning is ""Sirius - Eye In The Sky"" Damn! Diablo, Lord of Hatred, really let himself go  Tentaculars: *exist*\nHentai artist: *its real free estate* Looks promising, I\'ll give it a try. For some REALLY strange reason I have an urge to watch this, it’s like, calling back to my childhood cheap cartoon movie past or something  I wish studios would go back to hiring professional voice actors for films. Something about their voices here is just off from the character design. This actually looks interesting ""Mum, can we have the real steel sequel?""\n""No, we have real steel 2, electric boogaloo at home""\nreal steel 2 at home Finally, a movie where monsters and humans get along.  This might actually be a pretty good movie Looks good so far I\'d watch it How dare you make this perfect beautiful and cool yet also crazy movie in 2020 and to be released in 2021\n\n\nI’m to excited to wait  This is accurately better than what I thought it would be. Like someone else already said this movie feels 20 years too late and is jam-packed with cliches to where everyone can just look at this trailer knows how this movie is going to go and end. don\'t get me wrong it looks like it has an original idea and to a point and inspires people who do stop motion videos or story writers to come up with their own idea of their own version. Don\'t get me wrong the movie has its own great idea but it looks like it\'s relying on too many cliches to be able to stand on its own two feet and that\'s just disappointing. Rumble :  Exists\n\nGodzilla fans  : "" This is just a total ripoff of GvK."" Interested to see how hes gonna be him in the end Honestly this looks like a good movie hopefully it has a banger ost to back it up Time for me to enjoy this movie because I do not give a shit what anybody says :) \nI just enjoy animation and design :) I love how humans talk down to giant monsters If I know this movie from other different movies like this, Steve would win. 2001: Monster Inc\n\n20 years later As soon as I finally get over the end if Bojack, this happens. :,) I really like how this looks Despite the Tropes & that Selfie Bit I\'m still gonna give it a chance because hey I love me some Fighting Monster movies. The glow effect kinda shook me though, that was cool That Chicago bulls intro!!!!  Ok this gotta look dope  Why do I feel like tentacular is going to be just like jackson storm Ok the trailer is good. I really need to learn how to animate A cartoon about kaiju fighting? HELL YES! Is it me or is Steve the perfect role for Jack Black? 0:23 ele podia falar isso:\n\nA experiencia da minha vida\nEu vou te contar já que você não sabia Below you can see some comments from people who don\'t really agree with what this movie has to offer and I\'m with you guys.\nit would be inovate if they changed the plot (following the story of the comments these guys wrote below) and put Tentacular as the protagonist.\nit wouldn\'t be the typical story of the loser getting strong and eventually beating the seemingly strongest player, this story has already been heard a trillion times and if they leave things as they are the film would end up in oblivion. I would definitely see this movie. Rule 34 artist: ""what should I draw today?""\n\nRumble: Exists I wanna be one of those people who sit in the rooms where they plan the plots. I would\'ve liked it if the kaiju\'s didn\'t talk, but I love the idea of making the kaiju genre into a kids movie! ""There\'s a monster inside him?""\n\n""Did he eat one?"" I feel like there\'s gonna be a licensed movie game for this. I personally would like to see more hand drawn animation in movies instead of 3d animation “Sees the tentacle monster” welp, artist are gonna have fun drawing porn of that thing lmfao I kinda wanna see this just for the hell of it Is there a challenger-\nTitanus gojira: Hold my beer Animation used to have a good story back in the day This isnt too far off from actual wrestling in Japan and thats the real comedy in all of this So Kung Fu Panda with monster\'s??  Hell yeah, im in! I actually really like this :) The one movie we never knew we wanted and it turns out that\'s just because we don\'t want it at all ""Remember Sully""\n""This is him now"" I swear animated movies are now getting more expressing than last year. This is like that episode of Love Death Robots where they have the fighters control monsters I am so ready for that movie. Sometimes, I am forced to believe that Corona is a blessing after all..... dude i love how the voice of the main character is the voice of Ralph from wreck it ralph Movie: (exists)\n\nFurries and scalies: I’ll take your entire stock Calling it now, there’ll be a scene where Steve goes into a Berserk state or something.\nEvery nice guy in a film does something like that Tentacular does not cause damage in the streets. this  could be a  good live action movie I\'m so glad I grew up with the iconic Pixar movies since 2000 People are saying how the main guy (Steve), is like Sulley, but really, doesn\'t he feel like a monster version of Wreck-it Ralph? I actually really like it. I thought for once we might get a cool character that doesn’t want to be a wrestler anymore and loses to a monster on purpose to pass on his legacy to someone else I’m predicting this will get 30 percent on rotten tomatoes  OMG SO COOL! I WANNA WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! THOSE MONSTERS ARE SO CUTE AND HANDSOME!!! This is a very complete trailer for a 2021 movie, I\'m guessing this was probably meant for late summer or fall but is being pushed due to the virus since the virus is also pushing more hyped movies to the time this would have probably come out. Why\n\nWhen can we get an actually original and good movie this year\nThis is so stereotypical  This looks neat. The trailer in 9 months will look completely different I can\'t wait to see that ""Mom can we get sharktopus?""\n\n""We have sharktopus at home"" I can’t wait it looks so funny Part 9 looks amazing ""That\'s enough for today"" I can already imagine godzilla and king kong making a cameo in this movie fighting Basically, reel steel...\nAnyone remember that? Rumble: exists \n\nMe: why does this remind me of monsters inc Wow, I can\'t believe they made PopularMMOS Mod Battles into a movie! Someone either knew exactly what they were doing, or had no idea what was going to happen when they designed Tentacular Honestly while this is super original and fun looking, I wish will arnets character was a tiny bit more visually interesting, like maybe he had 4 arms just the other pair are smaller than the upper pair, maybe he could breathe fire, idk Seeing this made me realize that we have gone too far with animation I’ve never been more scared of shark my entire life This is Sonnie\'s Edge from Love, Death and Robots, only kid-friendly... I simultaneously want to watch this and avoid it at all costs. Also... 2021 is gonna be a real year and it\'s not time travel. AAAAAH! It\'s not even March yet and there\'s already a trailer for 2021? A pro wrestling movie with monsters... 2021 will be a crazy year. Holy shit.....it\'s one of the Street Sharks! They\'re making a comeback, lads. Will you watch the movie? \nYes, Maybe, Absolutely. Damn. Toho really made Godzillas new enemy have high graphics. I know its probably going to suck but I really like the concept 0:41 creativity at its finest Kaiju + wrestling? Hell yeah! The two wrestlers in this movie are going to be Hero characters and will work together to take down the main villain which will be a werewolf who uses dark type moves. Which means, in the second trailer, it\'s going to be showing that werewolf and 2 more hero characters which will be a canis (a type of wolf) and a jaguar. LET\'S GET RUMBLE TO READY...next year! This is gonna be interesting.  A bit nerdy but I\'ll say it: Tentacular is the perfect sea creature. A predator built for every type of prey? And breathing on land!? Wonder what he does in his free time? HOW THE HELL DID I KNOW THAT WAS GONNA BE HIS VOICE!? The gamers have now captured the furries and now forcing them to fight their own families for survival. I swear there are two moana Easter eggs I can see already in this movie:\nHow a fan says he has tentacular’s whole life story tattooed on his body (like Maui), and how tentacular’s scales light up like tomatoa the crab (idea if I spelled that right). I really hope they make Tentacular the main character... we’ve heard the underdog wrestler story too many times. me and some friends saw a movie recently, this was one of the opening trailers and i legit thought it was cloudy with a chance of meatballs 3 because of the music Shark man is gonna be on e6 and they know it. I mean they gave him tentacles and a build that would make Arnold jealous... Plus he\'s a giant. Music at beginning: starts\nMe: flashes back to Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs... How everybody who\'s not a furry thinks about furries. This: Exists\nRule 34: allow me to introduce myself.\nWow lots of likes Well, this movie\'s going to absolutely bomb. No one is going to remember or care about this by 2021 after this year is over.. lol.. Awful time to be in the production of movies that aren\'t anything but guaranteed gold. Lewis: your older cousin is tentacular \nSiren: yes! \nLewis: holy shit A monster rumble ?\n\nWell count me in I love the animation style tbh I want to see Ultimate Muscle in CG!! Furries after this: show time starting the draws for rule 34\nMe: AH, SHIT HERE WE GO AGAIN bro i first day this trailer in theatres going to see the sonic movie and my friend spent the entire first half of the trailer trying to tell me that this was scoob before giving up in defeat and saying “yeah so tentacular is hot” and that’s my story thank you for coming Let me guess, the orange monster is going to make many comedic attempts to get into shape all the while the girl is going to continuously say some general ""you can do it"" stuff while overwhelming him with a horrible training regimen that the monster ends up hating. He\'s going to get all mad and talk about how he can\'t do this and put himself down. They argue. They spend a while apart before the monster sees some thematically appropriate stuff or has a talk with Tentacular that brings him back to the girl where they make up. They end up doing some 3 to 5 minute training/climbing the charts montage and end up facing off against Tentacular at the end of the movie. Tentacular may end up being a jerk who pulls some sketchy shit to keep his title but it doesn\'t work because the orange monster now recalls something the girl said that makes him believe in himself. This movie is so awesome I mean, I really like the premise. It looked like nothing I ever seen. I was really hoping the shark guy would be the mc. Then it panned to that loser red monster and now I\'m afraid it\'s gonna be a worse version of Kung Fu Panda... When people say ""why isn\'t tentacular the main character"" when there is a reason they didn\'t make maui the main character of moana.\nPeople like Maui and Tentacular don\'t have many flaws. That is why people love then big strong dude covered in tattoos who can be shark and squid. If they had their own movies it would get bland real quick. Rumble Trailer: exists\nRule 34: It’s free real estate I love it!! This movie’s concept is interesting, but I REALLY hope they change up the plot. I can already see how it will go:\n\nMain monster guy is shown to be pathetic and unwilling to beat the obviously cooler Tentacular guy, who is a champion, but gets super plot armor and somehow beats the champion anyway threw stupid montages. I really really think this plot is overused, and just because it’s centered around children it can’t have a good plot, it can. IT SHOULD\'VE BEEN LAUNCHED IN 2020 Can\'t wait for the new gigantimax forms! I think Tentacular should have been voiced by Dwayne Johnson. Paramount Pictures: releases Rumble movie\n\nRule 34: my time has come i know the entire plot from watching this trailer If they don’t include “Life Story Tattoo guy” in the final film, then the entire film will flop! Godzilla: I\'m the king of monsters\nMe as referee: hold on you\'re not the king yet you still got more coming Ya...no....unless it’s a big time sequel, 2021 is pushing it for a brand new movie, especially an animated one. I wish they did this movie in a similar concept like the first episode of Love Death and Robots but ofc more kid friendly without the titties and the swearing... That would\'ve been really cool! But this right here looks pretty basic not gonna lie  So where do these monsters come from? Are they engineered? There might be an interesting history behind the world of this movie. Who else saw the thumbnail and thought Dwayne Johnson was going to be in the movie? This movie looked so awesome until I saw that it was just another, “Human becomes friends with monster” movie I’m actually excited for this. I’ll watch it. And to the haters, here’s a preemptive screw you! I watched this in the morning and completely forgot about it immediately until I got the trailer recommend to me again just now So I’m guessing that this movie is going to be like Kung Fu Panda and Godzilla mixed together? I saw this trailer yesterday and was like, whatever (like every trailer i see) and then when i went to sleep i dreamed about if i was on the theaters watching this, and then i left.\nMy brain legit wanted to remember the trailer from this movie huh. This can turn out two ways\n1. He\'s not ready but fights and is losing but then he remembers a lesson he was told and the shark guy is being cocky and distracted and he loses\nOR Everybody gangsta, till the pacific rim monster get to the ring I thought steve would\'ve had the lower part being the body of a horse and still kept the top part Huh, wasnt expecting this but it looks good. I really love the story idea but it could be so much better if the characters just didn’t look like that lol Calling it now, the tentacle shark guy is gonna be the antagonist in the movie not wanting to lose his fame, like that racer in the movie turbo How much do you wanna bet Steve will win at the end of the movie 2020 just started and they are showing trailers for 2021 ha love this... cant wait for 2010 I\'m pretty sure King Kong would kick everyone\'s ass in this movie Tentacular better be a good guy and takes the lost like a champ and shows that he is proud of the new fighter and giving him advice like, “there will be people who bring you down, but know they’re just voices. Because they are jealous of what you became today. A better champion than me.” The tentacle dude’s arm movement is cool though ngl This movie looks cool Hearing Bojack as Steve is really trippy I’ve been waiting for rumble This is a movie my black church would show the Sunday school kids on this “fun days” when i saw the thumbnail and the design i actually fuckign screamed of how awesome it was.\nWhen i heard the voice, i lost interest. Man that shark from nemo REALLY buffed up When it\'s 2021 im so seeing this movie I\'m glad that Michael Buffer gets to voice himself on that movie Best not judge a film just by the teaser, wait til the real trailer comes Shark tale 2 looks good Terry Crews as Tentacular, a shark-headed tentacled monster who is the reigning Monster Wrestling champion. An underdog story, cool. There better be something different about this one Bruh the starting music sounds like from cloudy with a chance of meatballs where Flint Lockwood cuts the ribbon  This animation is so smooth We need this NOW Tentacular: ""Come get some of this!"" \nFlexing tentacles\n\nMe: 0_0 ""Go get some of this!"" Hell no. A world where monsters are domesticated, and used in fighting as a sport...\n\nI have seen that somewhere before... TENTACULAR!!!!!AHHHHHHH I\'M IN LOVE RIGHT NOW AHHHHHHHHH!!! I feel like they could of done something with monsters that are wrestlers if the plot wasn’t so blatantly obvious If someone need soundtrack from the opening , there you go  ""Sirius • The Alan Parsons Project"" Se ve muy interesante People really judging the main character despite it being 1 trailer 1:06 me when I take things literally Back in early 2020, I saw someone say “Why is this coming out in 2021? It’s only February!” Underdog wants to be as good as the big gun in something he likes.\n\nHe tells this to everyone and they of course see this as a joke and don\'t take him seriously. I want too watch that rumble movie  Looks awesome Exactly like the monsters in Pacific Rim. “Hey is that the horse from horsing around” Wreck it ralph is literally a true monster Why is it that I want to see this more than \'Onward\' or \'Soul\'? This movie looks great So, for me it feels like Real Steal but cartoonish and with giant monsters. Holy 2021 \n\nSo long I can’t wait that long ""Next year""?! This year\'s only just begun!!! My first thought after seeing the thumbnail was “Sharktopus.” Haven’t even seen the video yet, that’s how worried I am. Especially since now I’m taking the factor of peeps ready to draw this kind of stuff. 1933: IT\'S KING KONG\n1954: IT\'S GODZILLA\n2021: IT\'S GODZILLA VS. KING KONG 0:18 que nostalgia da esa esena de la aleta aunque mi logo de canal parese que tambien es un monstruo kaiju de esa pelicula Alright we all know tentacular is the villain already. I have a feeling this will be a big meme lol Tentacular looks way too chill to not be one of the main characters The Producers of the Movie coming up with the idea\n\nProducer 1: Okay guys we need new movie ideas.. we need something... original and funny. The rock should be a monster in this movie I honestly want the shark guy to win The opening song was the same as cloudy with a chance of meatballs, made me think its the trequel The Big Dog and The Man are going to be in this movie......and this is put on my list of movie to see When I heard that beginning intro song I had flashbacks to Cloudy with a chance of meatballs Never has a trailer made me feel so meh in recent history. Me: mom can we get Godzilla?\nMom: we have Godzilla at home. \nThe Godzilla at home... Rumble\' we are talking about monsters fighting each other to be king of the ring\' \nGodzilla and King Kong \' are we a joke to you\' This feels like real steel Oh my god\nAnthropomorphic Hentai Shark Wrestler is real\nMy therapist lied to me,\nRun away, I must! Giant monsters!\nHere’s comes Jaws!\nBring out our two true monsters I thought the movie was gonna be about tentacular. Maybe for once we could have a movie where the underdog doesn’t beat the odds and win, y’know? Me: Scrolls back up in fear upon seeing the thumbnail This looks good. Hopefully the outbreak won’t affect this. Eh, it has a good concept and animation, but it looks really cliche tbh. This is Godzilla as an organized sport.\n\nToho, take notes, the fans probably want this. I hope WWE superstars will make  cameos there WoW!!!\nThis seems something totally new and never seen before!\nA looser who will become a hero, at the end.\nOutdated references for the parents and body gas releases for the kids. amazing video you deserve more views I really liked it This movie looks very convincing *Spoiler: the orange monster practice and have six pack then he eat again but he will be motivated and then win the blue monster. This is probably what it would be like if the humans and monsters of Monsters Inc. coexisted together I feel like they went through a closet and grabbed whatever axed ideas they had, plus it feels more like an early 2000’s movie. I dont understand how every start of the year theres always next year trailers and like ""Bro COME ONNNN"" So this movie is giant monster fighting but treated like a boxing match...\nALL THE YES Is this the merger of a shark with an octopus? it was good Rumble trailer: comes out \n\nRule 34: then its kowabunga time Wow, this King kong vs Godzilla movie looks pretty good This looks great I can\'t wait shark tale 2 sure looks a lot different than i remember it Thank god they didn’t say what month it gets released. Me:""Mom can I watch sharktopus""\nMom:We have sharktopus at home\nSharktopus at home: Tentacular\nHas a strong buff torso\nHas tenticales\nHis head looks like a shark With the opening music all I heard was “FLINTTTTT LOCKWOOOODDDD” and then the spongebob jellyfish rave party. I was really concerned by the thumbnail but I\'m glad he\'s a monster and not a horribly anthropomorphised Shark Bruh this is the real steel sequel we have been waiting for?\nEh.....good enough Can’t wait to RUMBLE Character design of the monsters and the humans could be waaay better for an interesting idea like a pro League of Monster Wrestling Finally , tentacular has come back to Monster WWF Movie Name: Rumble.\nSong Used: Let\'s get Ready to Rumble.\nMe: NICE I mean if anyone hasn\'t noticed yet Steve is voiced by the same voice actor as BoJack Horseman Kaiju breaking into the mainstream? Thank Godzilla. I couldn\'t be happier. I love this movie is so awesome Can\'t believe the monsters from Monster Inc. will compete in rumble showdown. I feel that The orange one is going to win against tentacular because that’s my opinion The hype will be over a half of a month, so..... this movie might not be cool later on. Everyone: they should\'ve made tentaculer the main character\n\nMe: they should\'ve made tentaculer the main character I would be way more hype about a half shark, half octopus monster voiced by Terry Crews as the main character than a whatever the hell Steve is.  They even had to use Tentacular as the thumbnail/opening scene just to draw viewers???  Get a hint Paramount. bruce the shark from nemo really had a glow up Actually that looks really neat no kidding I wish there giant monster villains in that movie No one:\n\nYoutube: Let’s put the exact same trailer as an advert before the video... If he ate a champion monster doesn\'t that mean he beat one? LITERALLY EVERYONE COMPARING THIS TO GODZILLA I\'m guessing the plot is about a girl that meets a monster that wants to become e famous wrestler and she decides to train him to probation get money for whatever reason then they will eventually develop a strong bond Rumble seems legit though not gonna lie Monster Wrestler: exists\nSquare Cube Law: I\'m about to end this man\'s whole career. The underdog won, there, I spared you guys two hours. Me:sees a giant buff shark\n\nAlso me:is that a gojitzu character Plot twist: the Orange guy and the buff shark start making out in the final battle. typical underdog wrestling story, giant mosnter fights with a unique and comedic spin, terry crews. this can either go really good or really bad. So basically he was a real sea god? This is the best line 0:36 I like the concept of this movie but there is no real need for the scale of the monsters if it is not played with. The sense of scale needs to be used for comedy or action to make this movie. For example, have one fall over and break something causing a controversy and making him unmotivated to be a fighter untill she comes along and helps him to chase his childhood dream, whitcb he tries and gets close but falls short making him sad again witch gets turned into determination after she talked to the monster and find how they went through the same things  and even thought they look like polar opposites of each other, they are the same A shark plus a kraken TWO OF MY FAV ANIMALS SO SICK I feel like Doctor Robotnic...\n\n“NOBODY CARES!!!!” If this isn\'t Nickelodeon then I\'m surprised Paramount Animation has been with Nickelodeon for a long time I refuse to believe that 2021 is a real year To be honest tentacular should’ve been the main character To like be  he’s a bigbest rookies  prospect grade and just brought down to earth and loses his fans and have to fight for his right to stay in the league and get some respect Having tentacular be the main guy would’ve been better. Having him be the reigning champ and then being beaten by another new commer etc 1 year later i forgot this was gonna happen Why in 2021?! Why not in 2020?? Is this is is a future modern, high quality, animated movie in very realistic graphics?? I don\'t think so! whos ready to not be surprised by the \'twist\' of tentacular being the mean spirited villain Imagine Buff Helpy\'s in there. Winnie\'s voice actress, Geraldine Viswanathan, is from Australia. Therefore, she had to practice her North American accent in order to voice Winnie. Missing link gained some height, weight and horns, but he still got the humour. Very exited for this Ah, the long awaited sequel to Shark Tale is coming boys... Let me guess, the red one is gonna win at the end? The very moment this was leaked, every porn artist and furry went to work. The yiff guys are gonna have a field day with this. Espero sobrevivir para ese año :) Me:2020 is the worst.                          2021:THIS IS THE BEST YEAR Hm... they could tell an interesting tale about the struggle of wrestlers, and how they are perceived as these larger-than-life figures that ate in truth impossible to live up to.\nOr... they could make fat jokes and tell a by-the-books underdog story. Its funny because i already know how whole story will go 7O% percent of comments gonna be about rule 34 artists ruining the show They could\'ve gone with any other joke for the trailer, maybe even for the movie, and they chose the ending of Grease for a training joke. Am I wrong for wanting a movie just about the shark guy? finally... something original How could the monsters not accidentally step on humans? ""hey aren\'t you the horse from horsin\' around?"" ""Did he eat one?""  Anybody else find tentacular far more interesting than the protagonist Steve? His tentacles literally twist around eachother to form arms and they work like hands and fists. Pretty cool. He can unravel them to have 3 different ones that can literally work like whips or tendrils to rap around his opponent and throw them around or slap them with them, his voice is cool, he’s really big compared to the other monsters out there, and his attitude seems funny and cocky. Far more interesting than the protagonist which is just a boring monster design with horns and spikes, is fat and lazy, can’t do any form of exercise and is just not interesting or cool at all. Should have had tentacular be the protagonist. Am i the only one that look at this trailer, and the only thing that comes to mind is dynamax? Definitely an interesting concept, but as of right now it doesn’t seem like it’ll be well executed No wonder Tentacular\'s voice sounds familiar. It\'s freaking Terry Crews.\nEdit: Also, Seth Rogen and Will Arnet\'s voice sounds almost the same. Am I the only one who as the feeling that tentaculer is going to be the villain in the movie? If it does happen, I would not be surprised damn, when did Bojack get turned into a monster? Can someone tell me the name of the song that plays at the first of this trailer, thats used for so many collosium scenes. 1:21 what kinda strength and endurance are we talkin about here? Lithia is pretty much the premise of kung fu panda just with wrestling monsters instead of karate animals, change my mind sometimes i keep thinking that all kids animations are connected in one storyline, wish they did that. smh So...Real Steel, but with pro wrestling monsters? Imagine if Godzilla just showed up to the stage i thought street sharks was getting a live-action movie XD aw man Steve is just hairless sully bojack must have been desperate to get his agent to sign him up for this I feel like Paramount is well aware of what rule 34 is, they know this is going to get lewded the hell out of This looks like the after math of monsters inc Let me guess, steve is going to win a fight against tentacular by the power of friendship  And now... The starting lineup for your Chicago Bulls!!!... Rule 34 artists: Wright that down, WRIGHT THAT DOWN! Wow baby shark really stepped up his game by far 0:24 Sharktopus on steroids There was a 3 second teaser of Steve trying to lift a sign.\nSong in that clip is, AJR - Burn the House down Estaría loco que aparezca el espanta tiburones ahí xD This reminds me of Real Steel You can tell that the Orange dude is going to be the new champion Im so excited lol Sharktacular: exists\nRule 34: showtime Music gives me cloudy with a Chance of meatballs nostalgia at the beginning I love this the protagonist looks like a side character..while the antagonist looks like a protagonist. Why does every other monster looks better than the actual main one, or is it just me? xd\nAlso these monsters should\'ve be just kaijus let\'s be honest... 0:43 Amazing :0 *Pillar men’s theme start playing* Lemme guess, the rumblw dude is gonna find a way to be the best have a montage and be strong and turns out the octopus shark was evil all along and gets beaten despite cheating. see people calling them small, too many movie have all these mega and ultra daikaiju as a standard *because they want to make them bigger than modern buildings or at least not look small next to them*, but most kaiju in the past were around 30-100 feet tall. This was still really big, and to be honest still made them interacting with humans actually make sense. In the new Godzilla vs Kong, Kong sticking his finger down at that kid would be like a person sticking their finger down to an ant. At least at 100 feet a human is like the equivalent of a three to five inch tall action figure. I mean King Kong back in the day at 20-60 feet humans would be like the size of Barbies and the old GI Joe dolls (or gerbils and squirrels for comparison). Make the kaiju too big and them interacting with people in any way becomes harder to think the kaiju even would or could. This movie is giving me shark tale vibes. Okay this acc looks really dope I’m getting tired of these vague one-word titles for animated movies. I’m gonna say it right now. This feels kinda like it should\'ve came out when the first cars movie came out. 1:31 Most King K. Rool players in Smash Ultimate The internet is a wonderful place.\nSo much creativity and imagination. Now all this needs is an old veteran monster wrestler voiced by the Undertaker. Can tell if it’s a good movie when it has hidden adult jokes lol For a guy so huge and has arms big enough to hold an airship and the height of a building, tentacular has tiny feet smaller then a car Who else replayed this like 10 times just to watch tentacular My “FourEyes Official Prediction” is:\nThis movie will flop hard at the box office and will score low on rotten tomatoes as another pointless animation movie with no substance in it whatsoever. Finally Godzilla can kick ass again You know, I remember seeing a questionable ""cartoon"" like this, and another ""cartoon"" of a similar name. I can already tell that tentacular is gonna be the fame hungry villain.\nI mean come on, its obvious. Tentaclar:come get some of this\n\nGodzilla:im about to end this man\'s whole career From The Creators of Tad and Sherlock Gnomes ️ Why is there “no I won’t watch the movie” option? I\'m 100% sure that sharktopus will be a new daddy in furry community I better see a diggity dang fight between a baselguese and deviljho in this movie  Anybody remember real steel? Yeah this is the same thing,definitely The main building is literally the Hall of Justice. When I saw at the thumbnail I thought it was gonna be another Shark Tale in a long history of monster wrestling there was no one like tentacular \n\ngodzilla : imma about to ruin this whole career So Tentacular is a Shark/Octopus hybrid? Feel like I hear about that before. The kid in the beginning that says “woooahh” really bothers me. His mouth doesn’t even match up with the audio News guy:  who has the courage to challenge the champion\n\nGodzilla: h e l l o t h e r e I can already see the fat one being the strongest by beating the big dude because he’s actually a jerk irl Let\'s be honest we all did this with our action figures Can\'t wait for the Yiff First time I saw this I thought I was high so I watched it again\n\n\nThis is my 7th time Michael Buffer: Let’s get ready to RUMBLE!! yknow, knowing that next year is 2021 and not the future is really depressing Godzilla: so yeah we dont actually kill each other we just fight for sport.\n\n\nking Ghidorah: pretty much, yeah true, yep The guy she tells you not to worry about: I shutter to imagine how hard it must of been animating his arms Bold of you to assume we\'ll make it to 2021 Godzilla: Are you challenging me? Damn real steel be hitting different Looks like they\'re gonna pull off an old trope again... the red guy won\'t make it until he starts believing in himself and/or in the sport... He probably won\'t even get fit (or change his physique to a more fit appearance) and just magically win the fight somehow. Isn’t that song at the start also from cloudy with a chance of meatballs? They should have some kind of Godzilla reference/Easter egg maybe have a quick shot of his spectating amongst the crowd or something. Sausage Party to Rumble...what a change!!! Furries and scalies alike gonna go ham over this one. That shark in the thumbnail has made me believe in god once again thank you for showing me the light to the path of god The entering theme is the same from cloudy with a chance of meatballs Is anyone still interested in this movie or is it just going to get a soft release on streaming services? That honestly had to be sully 30 years later getting a paint job OK the only thing that I’m mad about is WHY DID THEY SAY IT IS COMING OUT AT 2021 AT THE BEGINNING OF 2020 Yiff artists: allow us to introduce ourselves\n\nEdit: i have a big feeling some furries will be in love with tentacular This looks like a normal Nickelodeon tv show I feel like this should’ve been made by Disney. \n\nCause, monster inc. and humans. Pixar theory. Someone nominate him the most thicc shark of 2020 I guess Warner Animation Group completely broke REEL FX so hard after animating for SCOOB! and felt more dumber after doing that! so Paramount can forgive how bad they REEL FX have been treated.\nand Paramount? at least you\'re trying to make something original and giving Reel FX a purpose to help. but anyways this movie looks cool I would prefer a sequel to Real Steel. mothra could mop the floor with all of the monsters in this movie. I can hear the rule 34 artists from here Love thiss like gigant on AOT This actually seems pretty original. I have a feeling that tentacular is just like Ernesto de la Cruz from the movie coco The New Sharktale looks great!! Tentacular looks like a Splatoon boss Cats: we are the most strangest furry movie in history\n\n\nRumble: allow me to introduce myself 0:04 krl,adoro esse RAP do sanji do tauz OH LMAO I\'M CRYING, THERE\'S ALREADY RULE 34 ART ABOUT THIS MOVIE HOLY CRAP  Everyone is calling this a Godzilla rip off and I see no similarities besides the inclusion of monsters. There has never been a champion like  tentacular.   Godzilla has entered the hold my   Also Godzilla hold my beer This is like real steel except with giant monsters wrestling not robots boxing What? REAL STEEL is evolving!!\n\n*evolution music* So....can this movie be like ""Real Steel""??? Hmm... related to the Emoji movie but also related to Spider-verse hmm... Ngl the monster designs look awesome They even got SAS to voice for them Am I the only one that like the main character and the girl lol Literally a mix of tamatoua the giant crab and Maui When this movie is like 12 years too late Wait a sec. I’ve heard that background music before.\nCloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs Anyone? I can\'t believe Soo many monsters are trying to become the next Godzilla Let me guess, our main monster is gonna slowly get better and better until he finally gets a chance to fight Tentacular. Sharktopus is gonna seem nice and proud of him but when they\'re alone he\'s gonna say ""You don\'t belong here"" and orange Sully is gonna lose his confidence but the little girl is gonna build him back up and he\'ll fight Sharktopus and win. Or he\'ll lose and learn that it\'s not all about winning.       Is that about right? These monsters don\'t feel big all, they move so fast. And their voices don\'t echo at all. This is basically just like real steel ""Mom can i  watch WWE?""\n""No,we already have WWe at home"" rule 34 of this is goonnna have a blast,,, Hmm yes, \n-Anthro\n-Tentacles\n-Big and muscly Why did the beginning sound like Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs when he cuts the ribbon- well gets ready to cut it? This looks really cute Yes hooman, train that house sized monster. no possible backfire Strange person: are ready to rumble! \n\nMe: no :/  Está Mamadisimooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So...did monsters inc finally make nice with the human realm? *This exists* Not gonna lie kaiju wrestling sounds pretty cool So Bojack has begun voice acting after the finale season huh... I was hoping for street sharks :( Why do I have a feeling Tentacular is a villain? Waiting  Nobody:\nMe: OH NO HE\'S HOT Man what\'s with all these underdogs? I just wanna see a movie with a cool, but not too overconfident and cocky MC(wouldn\'t mind a bit of cockyness, adds character). Like Tentacular seems way cool but ik the movie is prob gonna paint him out as a horrible person or just someone that maybe the original character will team up with to fight something else. \nI hope in the movie the MC doesn\'t win and then maybe there\'s a lesson that, although you can try hard and struggle, you\'ll still be behind other people but that you should use that lesson to better yourself and not just act like you\'ll always be a loser. Since you should move at your own pace sometimes, it\'s not like you\'re supposed to have some 10min movie montage and get super strong. TBH\nI dont know what to think about this\nIt looks new\nBut also predictable (rumble trailer comes out) Me: MY EYES (Sonic movie 1 trailer throwback.) So Sharktopus is now in an animated movie by paramount... cool Am I the only one who thought this movie was going to be cool at first, but then get disappointed right after watching the trailer? When movie companies think this is what kids like these days Rumble: uma produção RIOT Games Me watching \nSo he is a shark....\nWait now its tentacles, mhmmm they turn into sexy bud? Whoaaaa nice nice \nWAIT AND HE GLOWS???  I feel like Jack black would\'ve been a better choice over Seth So this is what Bojack Horseman been doing after the show ended y\'all need to stop hating on steve. my BOY out here trying! People making Godzilla jokes, but dude looks a helluva lot more like Sully. “Is there a challenger out there”\nMe:Yes godzilla :) Paramount: Hey can we copy your homework?\nToho and Warner Bros.: Yeah just don\'t make obvious.\nParamount: So this studio can animate... The Sonic fan in me rages... The confusion about this movie to me is which one\'s worst?\nSpongebob movie 2020 or RUMBLE with a discount Godzilla who awkwardly flexes and makes me uncomfortable and cringe \nWhich one\'s worst? Let me head this straight, Where on earth is trailer #2?! Man this movie would probably be sick if tentacular was the main character \n\n(and uh no offense but also without any tentacles its weird for me) The monster remember me to ""How to train your dragon "" Well, some movie producer just discovered hentai. Saw this trailer when I watched sonic. Thought it was Pokémon. Not too disappointed Looks like jaws has been working out and grew tentacles at the same time I hope the monster evolve to deafet the champion I hoped it was a bigger kaiju battle There\'s another movie I know with the sound effect at the beginning of this trailer, does anybody know what it is? Movie : shows some cool monsters\nMe : well hey teacher tell me to learn about anatomy and drawing fiction character times draw these cute guys skeleton and muscle , this should be fun ehhehehehe :)\nN9te : they seem lacking some organs though might as well add some of them in hehehehe :) Like, I\'m the only person who will ask this, but like are there just groups of these (not going to say monsters because that sounds bad?) Giant people who just have to deal with small people or are these guys like mutated. I need the plot Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure: Baby Shark is unbreakable They should have made Tentacular the protagonist who\'s already a winner and thinks he doesn\'t have to try hard, but then he gets his butt wuped and has to work on being the fighter he once was. Oh boi\nAs a furry, I can already tell that tentacular and the other guy are in danger Fed 26 is my bday wth and this movie is funny i love it a great timing Looks like diablo is getting ready for his 4th installment Space Jam vibes are real. Tentacular: I’m the champion Uh HUH!\nKing ghidorah:no\nedit: I will like my own comment because nobody will There is no way you designed a character like that and not expect fucked up shit to happen, they knew and they went with it. Spanish version really matches, but the original voice of tentacular Don\'t really goes with him Is it just me or does tentaclular look like way bigger than the other one The guy:There has never been a champion quite like Tentacular!\nGodzilla:WTF is going on?\nStill Godzilla: squishes Tentacular sorry little worm I\'m getting Sully vibes from the red dude. monsters inc i want this to be more about the shark and less about the fat guy Plot 23B. A lovable loser is casted as the main character an is trained/ tossed into unlikely event to become hero. Looks weird but the plot is strangely appealing. Who is the voice actor for Steve he sounds so familiar! I cant wait for saber spark to review this Me: looks at sharktale\n\nAlso me: Ah sh## here we go again ""Coming 2021""\n\nConsidering the virus has postponed  many to even the 2021 and beyond. Chances are that this would be punshed either to the Winter release or 2022. Ok who turned Bojack into a monster? The movie: ""Is there a challenger out there?""\nMe: 0:53 Satan? This have to be the most random story concept ive ever seen So it\'s basically rocky but the main character is a kaiju? Will it Stream on Paramount Plus In 2022? They should just call luffy to finish this 2021- boi I don’t think we gonna make it— When I saw tentacular, I thought he was a chad Rumble exsits\n\nThe dust cloud in the distance:  UwU OwO I think a better title for this film would be ""Kaiju Brawl"". Oh my lord wowwwww epic Meanwhile in an alternate universe: downsized Godzilla but he is a shark with tentacle arms Who else remembered the starting music from cloudy of chance of meatballs Oh look at that. Yet another underdog story about the loser rising to the top. Give it credit a kaiju wrestling association is an awesome idea but this is seriously just looking like Kung Fu Panda’s story! And let me guess, the big charismatic champ is actually just an egotistical jerk of a jock who’s not gonna let anyone take him down and the overweight loser’s gonna become the new champ after learning to believe in himself. Been there done that. This is what happens if Pokemon and Digimon was NEVER created and Hollywood ended up as its replacement. Couldn’t stop thinking about Bojack every time that red guy spoke I would see it Just in case anyone’s wondering : there is 5 times more hentai of the MC (Steve) than of Tentacular.. This movie feels so old even tho its not eeven released Im just gonna delete  my search history real quick So this is what sharktopus in high budget and effort look like ""RULE 34 HAS ALREADY TOUCHED THAT TRAILER"" Man they just make literally anything now And because of Plot armor the main character will win, the antagonist will lose embarrassingly, and everyone will idolize the big red protagonist it’s always the same story. Does anyone know that opening theme kinda late but it would be really cool if Tentacular get defeat then later inspired and train Steve to defeat the new champion like some Rocky shit Is already 11 months ,we never get the Trailer 2 So we either cheer for terry cruse as tentacle hentai or bob from monsters vs aliens I\'ll keep watching bojack thank you So basically Sharkopus vs Giant Orange Hillbilly Monster. Coming to the Sfy Fy channel real soon. the main charackter is just shrek ....i mean he feels like shrek only ....less ""cool""... i dont really like the design of the main charackter it looks like a monster ag charackter and in a universe where a king shark octopus monster is the mike tyson boss i really expected some more obscure monster designs.....still watching this when it comes out because its monsters and wrestling This looks like an animated version of that movie with the kid who made a boxing robot with his dad who was a retired boxer and they started from scratch and made it to the big leagues. I forgot what the movie was called. Rumble: EXISTS\nAny vault monster from borderlands: TRY ME Wow, I can actually hear the r34. Alternate universe where sully didn’t make children screen but adults instead It\'s more funnier with the Bojack Horseman voice actor Honestly when I saw this trailer I thought it was Space Jam 2 I don\'t think even the people who created the trailer liked the main the character Giant mutant shark: Im gonna rumble this place!\n\nGodzillza: Bitch please At 0:03 seconds, does anyone noticed the background music is of Big Hero 6 movie , correct me if I am wrong.. Oh boy, can\'t wait for rule 34 to do it\'s magic! Coming out in 2021 \nMe: Hahahahah if we\'re still alive\nit\'s Corona time  Sorry but Tentaculer or whatever his name is seems like a MUCH more interesting and over all cooler character, and his design is just much nicer to look at. I feel like directors and film writers really don’t know what kids like or would want to see ;-; I think this movie will be fun, but I don’t understand some things; « Where did the monsters come from? How they can speak? What do they eat if humans are their friends? » Didn’t realize they were making a moving about the zorros Huh so this basically Godzilla meets (insert good underdog wrestle movie here), but horrible \n\nAlso was I the only one who felt uncomfortable while watching this 0:04 donde había escuchado eso antes? I actually made a doodle of a buff shark and somehow this gets created. Tentacular should be the underdog... he\'s more interesting! 0:32 Guy: Tentacular! I Got Your Whole Life Story Tattooed On My Body!\n0:36 Tentacular: Yeah. But WHY does tentacular need to be taken down? He seems like a cool monster and everyone loves him. Why instead have some other fat monster fight him? I\'ll watch this just because of Becky Lynch BACK IN THE NINETIES I think this is the quietest we’ve heard from SAS Honestly it doesn\'t look too terribly bad, I\'d give it a watch. Even in animation Terry Crews has to do that chest thing LOLOL Bro the rock can easily flex his muscles BETTER than tantacular This just feels like a toy commercial ""Will you watch the movie?""\nMe: 01:23 Theory:tentacular is evil in his lair in the ocean (maybe) he’s making a nuke to destroy the world This looks so bad in terms of visuals, writing, humor, and characters Bojack horseman finally became a monster These buildings are so big they would have their own weather changes. Hitler wanted a dome built so big that it could literally rain inside on a bright sunny day. This movie looks like it’s 10 years old I can already hear the R34 artists doing their thing. Yeah getting tired of movies with underdog character defeating the reigning champ or something like that. they should just capitalize on the main monster tentacular and make him the first avenger or something of a cartoon monster superheroes movie. Could make a whole universe out of him and this kinda movie usually dont have any sequel or any good sequel. So kaiju wrestling the movie?\n* inhales * who came up with this? if your on a computer customize the speed at 0.95 and you\'ll hear tentacular without autotune Here we go again with yet another underdog story about a fat/washed up/mediocre guy making it to the top to almost lose to the character with a cooler design but use the “power of believing in myself” to win the big match. Either that’s how it end or it takes the equally cliché “people’s champion” route where he almost makes it but wins the heart of the people. I’m sure this will keep the kids entertained but end up bland and forgotten. Do you know if we’re going to survive to 2021 Your protagonist needs to WANT to win if you want us to CARE if he wins. You can show him failing, but don\'t show him complaining and giving up. JUST LIKE THAT, you totally wasted a great opportunity, and you deserve to fail. First trailer I wanted to pay to see so I could say ""I only wasted $2"". Now I have to admit I wasted another 3 or 4 whatever mins of my life Alternate title:\n\n\nSharktopus 2: Return of the Sharktopus the only rumble I know is an alien robot hiding in the chest of a bigger robot I bet that roman and becky are gonna be monsters I\'m pretty sure Godzilla vs Kong is totally going to steal this movie. I\'d rather have Tentacular be the protagonist. Lo quería en español latino Rumble trailer;*exits*\n\n\nEveryone:I WANT TO WATCH THIS!! I call this Real Flesh. Bro they literally took the disco music from that episode of SpongeBob where all the jellyfish are dancing. ️ Wtf is this. Wow an animated move actually doesnt look like garbage gracias por el trailer vro People be saying it\'s gonna be bad and say they wouldn\'t go watch it, but why do you even care about it? Exactly. It\'s gonna release, people will watch it, some will like it, some will hate it, and people will forget it after a few days So SyFy gots a quality 4th movie for sharktopus hmmmm interesting The movies is like .  Replace that red monster with Sully and then we\'ll talk, Paramount. A BASE DO RAP DO SANJI DO TAAUUZZ Why nobody worries wbout that there are no more 2d cartoons ? I prefer old disney cartoons than modern ones.I can cry at the moment after watching how mufasa dies in lion king. I\'m surprised Will Arnett even wanted to act in this movie. This looks like an actually good animated movie Can somebody explain me why people doesn’t like the movie? I just want to know the reason Me: mom can we watch godzilla?\nMom: we have godzilla at home\n\nGodzilla at home: 男の子可愛い\nこれ観たいなぁ～\n青のキャラクター、一緒にいて楽しそうw\n友達になってほしいw Kinda sad the amount of effort that goes into the animation for such a monstrosity, pun intended i feel like this movie came 10 years too late Tentacles, macros, micros, daddy boddied furries. \n\nYeah this totally won\'t turn our kids into utter devients. Not at all, nothing bad has ever come about from animating anthros and butts. tries to look away from FA 0:37\ni need this song lol This sounds like hentai with more steps Prediction for this movie from me:\n\n\nThe orange guy is (as we see) trying to become a monster champion. Like Blue glowy boi. So he will start training and get better and keep forcing himself everyday to continue. He fails to do that so he gives up, leaving his dream behind in the dust. Then all of a sudden he\'ll find that he isn\'t going to give up because he has found some sort of \'purpose\' for himself and continue and he becomes stronger and goes up against Blue boi (Btw that was Orange guy.) Then Blue boi starts to destroy Orange guy and wins the first round. Orange guy gets defeated but in the last round he gets up and super charges and becomes super mad and takes out Blue boi.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2,"['X840MLgTzHc', 'eOFFPHhRLeY', 'RFtjndrCXEE', 'KbSEnqQbWAg', 'Ny6u58bC7XE']","['Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Watch our newest Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Trailer ➤  https://youtu.be/rQimPUSH3cM I know it\'s fan-made, but this trailer is really impressive! I really hope they give Sonic his super form in the next movie. Imagine how they could\'ve looked if they didn\'t redesign sonic in the first movie... So a combination of official and fanmade footage...\n\nCredits given. Fans:fine I\'ll do it myself I know that this is a concept trailer, but this is actually good to show what the sequel should be about. Great Job!!!! moment of silence for the people who dont know this is fanmade. this is pretty fun looking, i\'d watch a well made sonic movie sequel if the designs and story are this on point with his games. This is really well made, for a fan-made trailer. Sega should use this as the actual trailer. ITS AMAZING! The Green Hill music is amazing!  Looking foward to seeing the second sonic movie with Tales and Knuckles. This should be good and even the trailer is impressive Ok i admit, it’s really well done and fun to watch.\n8/10 It took me a second to realize this was a fan trailer, usually, they\'re always terrible at this. I know some clips are from the movie but the original animated parts are Amazing! This rederly gave me goosebumps bc of that one theme I like the only old sonic game I know an I hope to sure they\'ll add it in sonic 2 if they\'ll ever make one. The green Hill music tho-\nIt just brings back old memories back in the day when the franchise was still up and green Hill was part of the origins In the franchise  I’m so hyped for this new sonic movie Best one so far. Better than moving .PNGs on still backgrounds with some voices from famous movies spliced in. Just got finished watching the first movie. It\'s not the best but it\'s very adorable. \n\nHopefully the real trailor for the second one will be as good as this one. Wow this is a really amazing concept trailer well done ️ Impressive!!! We Loved It!! Hope Sonic 1 sees this and the 2nd movie comes to life!!  there\'s no explanation for the degree of impatience I have for the launch of this movie. omg, this trailer looks epic cannot wait for the movie to start!! One character I really want to be in a sequel is silver sonic (or robo sonic for those Lego dimension nerds) as he is just a slightly more buff metal duplicate of sonic, and I really like his cyclops esc eye. I am so excited for that movie to come out! I am a big fan of Sonic the Hedgehog! That intro gave me massive nostalgia Wow, we were shown the Echid clan. Everything, this is exactly what it is worth watching a movie for. I really hope they make it based off the sonic adventures sega dreamcast video game! Its always been a dream to see the whole video game as an actual movie.  This Trailer was beautiful  Dammit the music makes me goosebumps, just loop this music while sending my ashes to the outerspace 1:35 I just get happy chills when I hear the starting. Let\'s force them\nTo MAKE A GOOD TRILOGY man, people out here really typing out ""not real, fake"" acting like we cant see the ""conceptual"" in the title, unless they\'re little kids that dont know any better and believe everything they see online, also, for those kids who dont know what conceptual means, it\'s another way of saying its fan made Aunque no sea el tráiler oficial me gustó Ojalá que el tráiler de Sonic 2 la película sea real por que quiero ver la secuela Mais real que o sol da noite this is a masterpiece Espero que haya mucha velocidad en la nueva película de sonic. What I want: More Eggman like Eggman\nSonic acts more mature\nSuper sonic\nGoing back to sonic’s world. This is incredible. Love the music in the background done a right good job \nBrings back memories This was really good well done this is better than I thought it would be, good job! I know it\'s fan made dude , but the new Sonic 2 movie still looks very real to me , ya know? You know its actually good that they fix Sonic’s design otherwise we might not be getting this exciting sequel. I would hate to see how Tails and Knuckles would look if they kept the old design. The concept/fanmade trailer : exists\nLiterally everyone : its not real dont belive him its fake Era um homem muito feliz antes de ler o resto do título ༎ຶ‿༎ຶ Great work I love it I loved Jim\'s eggman he nailed it. This is great. ""You wanna get fast? Lets get fast"" \nMe: Classic line! This is epic! \n\nAlso Tails is adorable! I LOVE THAT LAST CLIP OF SONIC AND TAILS AT THE MOVIES I LOVE THE SOUNDTRACK SO MUCH IT IS SO EPIC EVER LOVE IT!!!!!! :D It\'s looks good man , i can\'t wait to see the next movie LOL THIS IS GENIUS!!!  If this is fan made my heart has been stolen! I\'m excited for the sonic the hedgehog 2 movie great work!! excellent edition...the fans are grateful! I just want a cool shadow, give me that and it will be a 7/10 movie already. I love the logo and the music, it’s amazing Hey!! It looks like they dropped that worthless costar for the 2nd film!  \nIdk why they didn\'t think Sonic himself was big enough to fill the spotlight for the first film... but I like that he\'s pal-ing around with tails and not some meathead human this time around. Sonic , Tails and Knuckles look so much cooler than ever before. Compared to the original video games. This looks awesome Fans seeing this trailer is out: “is it time to rise up again? Is it time to gotta fix fast?” Time shall tell. me thinking there is gonna be a new Sonic movie: :D\nme realizing its coming next year: >:( Omg i love it, i can\'t wait OMG ya quiero ver la película I really can’t wait to watch it I wanna see a fight seen between Sonic and Knuckles This makes me legitimately happy This is going to be a really good movie when it comes out Nice I’m super excited to watch the movie i love how he took clips of fanmade animations I can\'t wait to see Sonic the hedgehog 2. I just want to know what the music was. I loved this Green Hill orchestration/mix. Tail\'s design is soooo cute. This is really good! SONIC FINALLY FINDS THE CHAOS ENRRALDS OH MY GOSH!!!!! Hopefully we get to see super sonic in the second part Damnit I thought this was real… still great tho! and I was hoping it was the original Sonic 2022 trailer SO EPIC!!!!!!! 1:23 IS THIS SoNiC UnLeAsHeD First SCENE???? THIS GAME IS SO INCREDIBLE MAN,OH MY GOD,THIS BEAUTIFUL... THIS IS ART!! AMAZING!!!! Awesome!! I STILL CANT BELIEVE WE HAVENT GOTTEN A TRAILER YET I love it POV: So no one is gonna admire as like half where fan-made and from the first movie Although it’s not official trailer it’s still made Amazing and it is officially coming out. That was the best Sonic trailer  I have ever seen increible muy bueno the people who disliked this masterpiece dont know what true art is That movie was good! WOW this is SO cool me and my brother have been waiting for this There\'s millions of people I would like for the sequel zavok chaos tails knuckles shadow and basically every sonic character that comes to mind the sequel is gonna surprise everyone here Paramount and Sega: we have not come out with a trailer yet, just be patient.\n\nThat One Guy in his Basement: Hold my Blender Application and my Packet of Doritos... Now why did 3000 people dislike this video? I honestly wanna know Where can I get the song?? Sooo good . Great Trailer!!! me: hearing the sonic music in the game\n\nme: hearing the real sonic music in the movie I like how the movie version of Sonic has completely different story Anybody know who made the mix of the awesome Green Hill rendition? Imagine in the next movie eggman brings out the death egg and sonic goes like. “Isn’t it like the 50th time you’ve used that thing?” AMAZING !!!  I hope they leave Gamma out of the movie for good. He lived a great story then died. I don\'t want him to end up like how they did Shadow. Shadow died from saving the world just like how Gamma died except to free all the Birds. I don\'t want him to end up getting inside of the movie when he already died just like how Fans bullied Sega and threatened them to bring Shadow back even tho he already died in Sonic Adventures 2. God I hope sonic goes super in sonic 2 0:54 эту мелодию я узнаю из 1000 других,Здравствуй мое детство,Sega,и Green Hill Zone Finalmente sonic 2. Legal caramba This is gonna be awesome I swear I’ve seen the number one but I cannot wait for number two this is going to be awesome I LOVE the Remix of Emerald Hill Zone if they do a third I hope they add dark sonic great concept! This is awesome I’m so excited for this movie to coem out Is this the actual trailer Trailer top It’s Beautiful it  makes me cry bro this is fanmade and it looks amazing This puts a smile on my face. Wow it\'s beautiful This is out of this world I\'m excited This Soundtrack from Green Hill Zone is really awesome Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i got Free from here\nWHATCH NOW  https://j.mp/3oIsKzZ  Does anyone know what this EPIC green hill remix is?? It hits HARD I really liked it, and the song was super epic, I loved it  sonic exe: does anyone gonna remember me after this movie?\nsonic the hedgehog 2: no Honestly all though I can see this is fake I gotta give you the credit for using clips that all connect to sonic. Stop! You’re making me more excited for the sequel! Omg I hyped this trailer looks cool I’ve been waiting Nice trailer  you did a good job imagine it was official the best part in the trailer was when they changed the sega rington back in the day it felt scratchy I love it bro i cant deny it its the bet fanmade trailer everr ive seen off sonic :DDD You all know what you were thinking when you saw that red lightning. For being a concept trailer this is super sick! Fuckin love the Green Hill music wowwww  It’s WAY better than the rest of the fan made trailers Pretty good! Just to tell you guys because most people never understand this first movie was based before sonic landed on green hill zone, notice how eggmans mustache was shorter/longer than in the games and how he makes it look like in the game when he gets transported to the other dimension? This is because that was the backstory of sonic, and he will be in green hill zone in the new movie because this is before he was there.  Sees the new sonic trailer: :D\nthe trailer is well made: :D\nlooks real: :D\nits a fanmade: :( Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ni got Free Gift Cards from This is better than the old sonic movie trailer! Well.. the improved it.. I thinn Good fan :)\n\nThe sonic teeth still haunts me :( Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ni got Free Gift Cards from This looks like the official trailer\n Good job!  Plot twist: they used a bad animation version of sonic in the first movie as a marketing technique so people would meme it to promote free advertising, Smart thinking by SEGA oh my god i cant waittt! THE FIRST SONIC MOVIE WAS FUN AND VERY FUNNY. BUT SEEING THIS IT IS GOING TO BE EVEN BETTER. I DIDNT EXPECT THEM TO GO THIS FAR WITH SONIC CHANGING INTO THE YELLOW SONIC. THE TALES AND KNUCKLES LOOK AMAZING THE DESIGN AND EVERYTHING ARE FANTASTIC IMPRESSIVE.  JUST WAIT UNTIL THEY ADD EVERY HEAD... INTO THE THIRD SONIC MOVIE LIKE FROM SONIC X IT JUST GOING TO BE MORE AND MORE AMAZING I AM SO EXCITED! CANT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE TO COME OUT IN 2022 OF APRIL 8TH OF NEXT YEAR. KEEP IT UP SEGA. I just realized that movie is Coming out 2 days after my 16th Birthday......IMMA BE READY Please who would want these characters.\nI\'m am the real SonicTheHedgeHog \nAnd everyone knows it and just can\'t admit it. Thank you for not clickbaiting like everyone else does I LOVE the music you used! Yes a actually good one That was awesome!  My Brother must be happy about his favorite movie because he is the Real Sonic Fan.  Me hoping shadow was in it  How did I find this Надеюсь имено такой трейлер! Can you please tell me where you got the Green Hill Remix from? how you can tell he\'s a fan-made\n I almost believe it As good as it looks, it’s too bad that it isn’t real Amazing!!!!!! SEGA !!!!!!!! o.o Why do Flash, Quicksilver and Sonic make Superspeed look so fun? That music was a banger omm keep that shit up Could you make a fan made trailer of One Piece?\n\n(If you haven\'t watched it, it\'s definitely worth the watch) pretty good for a concept Given it\'s sonic 2 I think Emerald Hill music would be better. It look like it was real man cause, it has to be an actual trailer :3 I want to see Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, Sticks The Badger, Sonia, Manic, Queen Aleena, King Max, Orbot and Cubot, Sleet and Dingo, Vector the Crocodile, The Lightning Bolt Society, the villagers in Hedgehog Village, Nominatus, and Shadow the Hedgehog. tails is adorable Most of the scenes are from the first sonic movie I remember February 14 2020 when it came I watch it I honestly think it\'s the real trailer. Cause, it did show out the date it\'s gonna come out in theaters, it showed sega (which made sonic) and many more. But, I\'m not sure though. What I do know is that the sonic the hedgehog 2 movie isn\'t coming out this year and it\'s very possible for the creators of the movie to make a trailer this year, so that people can be hyped and get ready (something like that) for the movie next year. If you think there was some parts I didn\'t get right, correct me. ITS FINALLY COMEING IN 2022 Romans 10:9-10 ""That if you confess with your mouth, ""Jesus is Lord,"" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved."" Modern finally looks good I can\'t wait for Sonic the hedgehog 2 I can\'t wait for the Sonic movie to come out I am a really big fan of him what should I say Sonic 2 movie my favorite character is Sonic and I\'ve loved the first movie and I think I will go see the second movie I am a really big fan of him I hope it\'s a really good movie I can\'t wait to see it 別物として見るくらいが丁度いい I NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is coming out in April 8. I love how they just reused footages from the last movie LOOKS BLOODY REAL MAKE GOOD JOB BRO Colleen o\'shauessey as tails the fox, and Emma stone as Amy rose will soon appear in sonic the hedgehog 2 movie, while Amy rose is confirmed.

Cant not wait this trailer must be 1 year to the future This will take a long time for it to come out You are a great animator OMG THIS IS SO COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I’m pretty sure some of these clips came from part 1 The end tho lol 1:44 I SEEN THIS BEFORE!!!!\nStop eating Tail\'s popcorn! You have your own popcorn you can eat!!!! people might get freaked out when it said ""only on theaters april 8, 2022"" (Sonic): turns into super sonic\n(Knuckles): Silent. remember the old sonic design for the movie lol Waiting To See It I was almost convinced by the title that this was real I think I saw the movie online with false 3D effect as well! I like this sound and animation you knows its fanmade when you know the actual sonic design YOU\'VE BEEN HOODWINKED, BABY!  It\'s not the real trailer but if was awesome I like it Excellent Anyone know the song at the end card please? Sega rn: FINE ILL MAKE IT JEEZE my eyes lit up when i saw gamma lol not really real, it just used clips from the original movie and other fan made movies that actually came out earlier than the original one Nintendo: si hay una película de Sonic abra una película de Mario ._. Wow this movie next here this must be good movie I can wait see That Sonic Voice Is Alike Sonic’sVoice In @Sonic And Amy Squad U can easily tell its an animation WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE BACKGROUND MUSIC I NEED TO HAVE THIS AT FULL BLAST IN MY KITCHEN PLEEEEEEAAAASE Wow!  Круто, только почему то есть кадры из 1 части So good Tails: i will beat you \n\nCameraman: really WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE SONG THAT PLAYS AT THE VERY END  Is the movie here? Because I wanna watch it Must have the emeralds of chaos When will we see The Hero of Color City 2? Wow just wow I will freak out if sonic goes super sonic in the second movie Where\'s Shadow? Our hope is that guy after Sonic. This is cool  i hope jim carrey is ok without no hair i was upset when this first one came out on tv i  was thinking where is his gone Creators of sonic the hedgehod:You think I\'m some sort of joke? But since when ... Tell me that this is a lie and that you are going to improve it or just tell me that it is only done by the fans because that does not seem to me ... Why sega... WHY DO WE HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR!\nEdit: I got an heart on my comment. SOMEONE LOVES ME i love sonic The animations you used that weren\'t from the Sonic movie I\'ve seen already that you used to make the so-called second Sonic movie wooooo new sonic Idris Elba as Knuckles The Echidna (voice) wish it was real tbh Epic The robot looks edited so is that airship from the beginning of the trailer I think they should still wait a little more time saying it’s just the animations little off that’s it Well I hope people do realize this ain’t real just fan made I hate when fan trailers just use the previous movie as 70 percent of the ""sequel"" trailer. You are awarded no points and may god have mercy on you soul. I love this music what is it like green hills or smt? Tá de fuder esse trailer The fanmade is cool <3 if theres tails knuckles, and super sonic theres no way im missin that shit its just so fake I love it The part where there’s red lightning that could be shadow or sonic.EXE looks almost original i think there will be a metal sonic Nice fan trailer So my question if they put metal sonic in sonic the movie 2! epic I love the red sonic it soo cool Just because it\'s a fan made doesn\'t mean you don\'t have to Not give credit to the people who made the video like you just slap other people into your video like it\'s a dust They promised me knuckles, where is knuckles? A. Classic going to the big screen OH MY GOSH I AM SO HAPPYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY Mythical, with music from 2022 (i.e. when sonic 2 #sonicmovie2 This is one of the decentest (is that a a word?) trailers I’ve seen I see fan art but man gamma looks good 1:04 bruh the graphics don\'t even look real... I like when sonic becomes super sonic CAN SOMEONE LEAK THE REAL TRAILER Kapan ya sonic the hedgehog 2 rilis Wow u couldn\'t know this is fan made Me sooo exited Wow could of just said it was fanmade then it will be good If we do get super sonic in the actual move then... hyper sonic? In number 3? Plz? Star light level one sonic the hedgehog 2\nEmerald Hill zone where Dr Robotnik rings\nIncluding dwayne johnson voice knuckles\nColleen O\'Shaughnessy voice tail Watching sonic 2\n\nI didn\'t even watch sonic 1 lol Just really enjoying the music Eee este video predijo la fecha de lazamiento de sonic 2 dios mioo I didn\'t expect that this is a fricking fan made trailer cuz there’s no knuckles My amazing sonic Very good sir! Faaaake but very well put together Where can i find this version of the green hill zone theme? This trailer looks fake but e-102 gamma looks so real I have seen the first sonic film like that and even I got DVD of it still  but not this second one but I will do for Christmas from next year but not this year coming up I hope it’s real Did anyone else realize the bad guys from the start was knuckles species? Read the title before you just decide to dislike... What\'s the song used in this? Bruh I was really happy Nice fan made trailer though Perhaps they should make the Nightmare version of Sonic called The Sonic.EXE Isto é mentira o trailer verdadeiro é um titulo do filme o trailer novo vai ser em 2022. that\'s not the real trailer huh why Was excited to see this but its fan made damn it Me encanta sinic SONIC IS MY CHILDHOOD NOW ITS COMING CAME Im hoping the ship and the robots don\'t actually look like that in the movie cause they look totally fake What about the song ? Can I download it ?

Well done! This honestly looks sick. For a fanmade trailer, this is fucking beautiful, well done. This honestly looks awesome!!! I really hope shadow is in the next movie. There have been many references of shadow being in it. This is good unlike other concept trailers I would believe it was real if it didn’t say concept Y\'all make the best ever fan made trailers This movie looks so sick I’m excited to go see it 1:24 Am I the only one who thinks that the way Sonic looks in Robotniks Glasses foreshadows Mephiles to be in the third movie?

John Wick: Chapter 4,"['56pvThSsoSE', 'f204ICpO0fA', 'Trz91Q8ouU0', '0nNI6Gz_eWk', 'defCouTQNpE']","['John Wick: Chapter 4 So here I am, all excited until I realise it\'s fan made This actor is actually an amazing human being in real life. If there\'s a fifth installment it needs to be a prequel ""John Wick: Baba Yaga"" hopefully it\'ll show the 3 men with a pencil scene. I\'m more shocked that he was able to kill three men with horses in a barn I am so excited about this. If you, are not a John Wick fan. Then you, need to see all three. I have all of them on . Can not wait for the fourth one.  So excited  amazing. didnt even notice it was fan made. this was actually really well done. fantastic job!!! ""Thanos, we have a problem.""\n""What is it?""\n""John Wick. He survived the snap.""\n""So what?"" ""This is a FAN MADE trailer"" needed to be in the video title Mr Reeves is described throughout the media as one of the most thoughtful, respected and down to earth actors ..despite being world famous..congratulations.. Vai ser foda!!ja to ansioso! iam waiting for chapter 4  This is going to be the best John Wick yet, I can feel it in my bones. A melhor sequência de filmes do gênero ação é totalmente de mais . Damn. I was really hoping this would be the real trailer. I bought the movies and found to fall in love with them. I love the action, fights and the guns. Looking forward to seeing the 4 & the 5 movies. I just hope they don\'t kill john wick in the end after everything he has been through.\nThey should give him a happy ending I\'m hyped up for this new john wick movie to come out I honestly like this trailer more than the other one. \n\nAnd yeah Don LaFontaine\'s voiceover helps a lot. I don\'t know about y\'all, but I would really love to see John Wick: Impossible Task. Love ""John Wick"" .. we want chapter 4 This man is a legend in the making he makes you feel the movie One of the best movies I\'ve ever attended and one of the best actors I loved the movie so much waiting for the fourth part seems to be great️ Lo espero !!! This looks freaking awesome! Can’t wait for its release I can\'t wait to watch it. All the love to Keanu as John Wick this fan made trailer is made really well i honestly enjoy it more than the actual 1,2,3 john wick trailers. i’m so hyped for an official trailer to come out. Extra kudos for naming this resurrection and then his new Matrix 4 movie actually being called Resurrections  One of the best action movie series ever Never hesitate from 3 things:\n1. Waking up early cause it\'s good for your health.\n2. Making money when the opportunity is in front of you.\n3. Making peace with John cause it gives you a chance to remain alive. Chapter 4 is very  impressive  John Wick 1 to 3 was insane. Absolutely Amazing!  Just seeing John Wick 4 makes me happy. Loved the fan trailer it was amazing! I also loved that you used parts of Hitman, which is definitely an underrated movie. Amo o Keanu em qualquer papel Devia como esse filme ter continuação também no filme dele Constantine. Waiting for the real tráiler...even so, this final chapter promises a great action movie! Man!!!!this is my fav movie  can\'t wait Muito bom. Já vi. I CANT WAIT TO WATCH JOHN WICK 4 !!! You know the hype is real when you see so many likes knowing it\'s a fan made/fake Can’t wait to see it!! Basically, you can add a clip from Bill & Ted and Keanu will still be badass. Finally, im so excited to see it omg This is gonna be soooo good!! I can\'t wait too see it  I have seen all of these except 4.  I admire this man, his history, and all that he has appeared in to be good in my eyes.  Love you Keanu Reeves.  Car hop trays from amazon, stay safe. God Dame this is going to be the best John Wick yet We should all be like kenu he seems to be the most relaxed honest person I can’t wait for this film to come out I want to say I would finally ends and see who wins the high table or legendary hitman John Wick Quando chegar no último episódio , iremos descobrir que foi  o cara dos pombos que mandou matar a esposa dele para poder governar toda a cúpula de assassinos.\n.\nE quem vai caçar ele vai ser o bicho papão com sangue nos dentes. Can\'t wait for Chapter 4  Release please please please. Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩 For Wick to survive all this, I bet he will become the head of the table.\nWhat is not impossible about his survival so far? Waiting John wick 4 I will waiting last 2years for this masterpiece movie Trust me john wick will be the best action movie you will see in your entire Lifetime Looks so good ,can’t wait !! I like how the film connects 1to4 and using the same characters Well, I think that keanu Revers is one of the best actors that exists today, without wanting to disparage anyone.\n\n￼ Waiting for one of my favourite movies ️️️️ Parabellum is 100 %  awesome. Hopefully, Resurrection is same too. I am waiting for John Wick 4 impatiently. This cant be the last one. I love it Chapter 4 നു വേണ്ടി കാത്തു ഇരിക്കൂന്ന മലയാളികൾ എത്ര പേര് ഉണ്ട്... I must admit pretty damn good job! ""You pissed John?""\n""Yeahhh""\n\n- Sounds like Death to me Can\'t wait to watch this movie  I finally can\'t believe this. One my best Fav movie  ever  waiting for boogyman\n\nLove from kerala John wick 5th chapter confirmed.... we are waiting for chapter 4 baba yaga Espectacular Я с нетерпением жду этого I\'m still looking forward to it Need to see all of them. To get the sense of what ,how he get things done right. Then you have the right one. There\'s a reason why they call him Baba Yaga. He that dam good. quero assistir o JhonWick4 já em 4k ou 8k logo kkkk acutally I  loved it.though it\'s editing and fan made but u killed it Love this full chapters, let`s go for it CHAPTER 4 Estou ansiosa esperando o John Wick 4,ver a vingança do baba yaga com a alta cúpula e sai da frente q o John vai vir furioso Extraordinary fantastic mind blowing Whenever John Wick gets pissed off, he always says “YEAH” Interesting how they showed clips from other movies. The Bear one was from when Keanu played an oil company “facilitator”, the Red Audi was from Hitman Agent 47. I am still anxiously awaiting John Wick 4 o monstro reeves está de volta John Wick, I have no idea how he survive that fall. Caso Deus um dia resolvesse eliminar o diabo, com  certeza ele  chamaria John Wick... ""Quem tem medo do Baba Yaga?"" Oh my godness... This awesome ""Baba yaga"" at the end. Can y’all just turn this movie into a series please?  nada mal un buen fan made por un segundo me la creí The troops are no alike on the Wolfenstein but no one could defeat John Wick xD O wowww. Didn’t know there is chapter 4. Just finished all chapters last three days, beside overwhelming shootings and fights, the movie is awesome  Looking forward to seeing this movie Have all 3. Can’t wait for the fourth. Hell yeah I can\'t wait omg  This guy is more than a legend, and beyond humble.. dead ass he takes pt(public transportation).. A man of focus,commitment and sheerwill- Baba yaga Can\'t wait to see that action again OMG Babayaga coming back  This thinks is made from many movie but still.. well done Wow I can\'t wait to see the part 4 of that movie Aaah can\'t wait anymore dying to see this chapter 4 of John wick Reev\'s action too much eager for movie Esse cara é foda, i am brazil get shots so many and fell from rooftop hitting stairways and shelter yet he survived.  yeah…..what a movie I like the part where they put cuts from Hitman  in with previous John Wick clips! Nice! This was pretty well done could have used clips from the nobody trailer for sure Can’t wait I can\'t wait. I live for this. I\'m waiting for a long time.now very excited to know that ch-4 is coming  Im a biggest fan of this film I\'m not really buying this trailer but I do hope they make a John Wick 4. Totally fan-made..  in fact, there\'s a few clips from ""Hitman"" (when he pulls the guns from the Ice machine & when the detective sees the dead SWAT in the elevator) John Wick might as well become a Avenger!! Film de fou...j’adore Keanu probably the most hearted human in Hollywood.,  Can\'t wait to watch wick 4 Wow，he really is The One. Resurrected in both JW and Matrix John Wick 4: Back, and Wicker than ever John Wick is like Tom Brady.  He gets better in every sequel! I love you Keanu  @john wick 4 heyecanla bekliyoruz ilk 3 bölümü tekrar tekrar izliyorum doyamadım filme  I heard donnie yen is in chapter 4 from the official page of donnie yen so this trailer is fake but yes movie is coming nd there will be another diamond donnie yen This was quite convincing !!! I\'m one with the Wick and the Wick is with me Pretty good, so I\'ll give you a like. But please put \'fanmade\' in the title, not just description. No way in hell john would\'ve fully recovered from that fall tho. Maybe in part 4 he can be part machine. Unlike the FF or the MI franchise, this just gets better with each episode. The funny crazy think about Keanu Reeves. Is, he looks like a real assassin in real life.  His demeanor outwardly seems very calm and personable. But can take you out in 2 seconds with a fucking pencil. O cara é imortal. Kkkkkk Here I am coming to see John Wick after watching Leo Prinsloo lol had no idea that John Wick is a movie . I\'m gonna watch this movie now lol Am still waiting and keep hoping that it should be like the rest and it should come out wonderful I\'m very excited Fan Made Trailer... They used clips from another film Keanu Reeves was in called Siberia and clips from John Wick 1-3. Was really well put together tho so props for that but I can’t wait for the actual John Wick 4 trailer to come out :) Keanu Reeves is life Omg this was so well made!!! Waiting  Excitement overload️️️ Lo amo me encanta I can\'t wait for Keanu Reeves to finish and release ALL the movies he\'s been working on!  I want to see ALL his movies! otimo filme Even though it’s made up, Keanu did say as long as we wanted more he’d keep making them The only movie franchise that just gets better and better not a single one can match it. Esse filme vai sr pancada! Amazing movie This is not the fourth part! The video is taken from several films and 3 parts by John Wick. I don\'t remember the last time I laughed so hard! I could definitely tell some of the shots were from Hitman I can\'t wait to see John wick 4. cant wait ! Keanu ️ Çıksın ama artık. Sabırsızlıkla bekliyorum gelsin artık Super fã de johonwick ️ John Wick in nature would be sick I’m so happy this ain’t the real trailer  Can’t wait  AHHHH I’M SO EXCITED Aw man i thought this was real well i cant wait until the REAL trailer gets released then Pro tip : New trailers won\'t have much of the previous movie\'s scenes . Someone tell them that ""baba yaga"" does not translate to a tough killer. In fairy tales it is character, an old witch who lives in the forest I like how the 50% of scenes are from other movies,like hitman Na verdade JOHN WICK é (NEO) de Matrix. Reinserido na matrix e com parte de sua memória apagada por pedido próprio, JOHN é chamado e levado ao mundo das maquinas novamente, e tem o conhecimentos dos fatos passados, assim é reinserido na matrix novamente a fim de executar e aniquilar oque comprometeria o futuro das realidades. Assim JOHN NEO terá o futuro de tudo em suas mãos. Bro this finna be the best movie ever. I love the John wick movies. I’m actually waiting them right know. How did i just fall for a fan made clip.. good one ""Take care of a garden and it takes care of you back, few things work like that."" I love that! I cant wait to wach Petition for making rule to put the word “Fanmade” in every fanmade and concept trailers title and not discription and pin comment Can\'t wait for chapter 4 They Really need to just call the film Baba Yega Кто нибудь скажите им, что ""баба яга"" не переводится как крутой киллер. В сказках это \nперсонаж, старая ведьма которая живет в лесу What will be his final weapon? Crayola? Needle? Button? Leaf?  Super move.... I\'m waiting Can’t wait it’s gonna be great Wow i cannot wait 244 days its looks so good lol i guess ill forget about jhon till 27 may but jhon is so good wariar I have a funny feeling that, when the dust clears, the high table will have two people sitting there... John Wick and the Bowery King.  And beside them, will be Winston.  Of course, it won\'t be All of Winston, just his head- on a spike. This is going to be so fun i need chapter 4 in this month!!  please release it in 2021...!! me encanta keanu ️️️ I watched John Wick 2 first, then 1 and then 3. Haha it was like a past, present, future viewing experience in that order. His looks say it\'s an old movie  Keanu Reeves, l\'uomo più bello del mondo   sia dentro che fuori! MEU PRINCEPE ETERNO que os anjos te guie sempre BJS EDNEIA do Brasil  Knew it was fake from the moment I saw the ""TEASER"" part in the thumbnail and then read the description just to confirm it. Excellent Teaser Trailer  Quando vai ser a estreia ? Time cannot slice this current master film in 2021 Wow I can\'t wait I\'ve never been Betrayed this Hard before impresionante el sr wick regresa They haven’t started filming John Wick 4 yet.  This is fan made. Wating oh my ! Just precious moments  Keanu Reeves!!! The only chapter I\'m missing from wick collection beklentiyi yüksetmeyin bence önceki filmlere göre zayıf bir aksiyon ve senaryo olacağa benziyor gelince göreceğiz elbet Dame. I\'m impressed and entertained. Well done . Thanks everyone for your likes and comments, I love you all It\'s my favorite movie with all parts I m excited for ”BABA YOGA” Chapter 4 it wasn\'t bad for a fan-made trailer.\nnice job man. Jst can\'t wait, enough said  John wick chapters the best I\'ve seen in my life I am very happy and excited to see wick ch 4 legend actor yrrr I also wanted to be like him  So hyped for a moment, then there was hitman movie clips  omg!! i cant wait to watch that I can\'t wait to watch this what a fantastic job So excited Один ""баба яга ""хорошо, а два лучше, ожидание смерти хуже самой смерти Can\'t wait... Yeah, “John Wick 4 - BABAYAGA Bites Back” So here I am, all excited until I realise it\'s fan made When John Wick installs Windows, Microsoft agrees to its terms and conditions. This is epic John Wick is Gone... ""How far did he get?"" Best quote EVER... :-) Welcome back wick  The John Wick universe is a universe that is similar to an action shooter/fighting video game. The every day citizen understands that they are second-class citizens to the assassins that walk around amongst them as displayed in multiple scenes where John Wick is seen engaging in combat and the people around him have blatant disregard for what is happening as to not intervene with the main characters actions. Completing tasks/jobs for awards the style of apathy amongst the citizens is that of an NPC and Instead of the world revolving around the universe, the universe seems to only revolve around John wick and the enemies he encounters. Him being the main character in the universe and everyone else being secondary and only becoming relevant when he interacts with them. Honestly I\'m more excited about mr. Wick than mr. Anderson. How to spot a fan-made trailer that doesn’t want to admit it’s fan made:\nOfficial channel? If not then probably not real.\nScenes from other movies? Probably not real.\nBoth? 100% not real. Gave you a thumbs up because you specified it was fan made. Thank you. nice. very convincing. keep up good work. I want Morgan Freeman in this movie This is an awesome fanmade teaser! I read somwhere in chapter 4 will be Donnie Yen as well??? not sure but im exited. I heard thieves came at Keannu\'s house but left immediately after seeing boxes of pencils everywhere We are waiting  from tamilnadu ️️️️️️ i know this is Fan Made, but it just get\'s my juices flowing! I\'d like to see John Wick out int he wild!  Taking out baddies with a musket.   That would be cool AF. Can we get a video game at this point ️ I can\'t wait to see John wick 4. they should make john wick 4 around this trailer How many times can John Wick be killed?  Big series, big scenes, Fantastic cinema photography.  ""Get out of Jail free coin"" John Wick... All the way.  Damm it thought this was the real trailer, good work!!!!!!!!! Hardly wait to know what happened in john wick 4 The moment it swapped to Siberia I was like clearly people haven’t watched enough movies  I knew it would be fan made but still not bad. The pup\'s the real star of the movie and Keanu will tell you that himself. BABA YAGA Sudah tak sabar ingin menyaksikan alur cerita ini dn kapan bisa di liris yah ? Baba Yaga  India has KGF and Bahubali, Hollywood has John Wick!! Ya la quiero ver  Perfect edit keep it up God !! I cant wait this movie JW4 The next is matrix or Constantine may more fantasy  dammit, I thought we were really gonna see the trailer ""This is a FAN MADE trailer"" needed to be in the video title Por fin ya mostraron un cortometraje de la película de Jonh wick 4 hace tiempo que quería verla Looking forward to john wick 4 and many more hopefully. \nWick4Like I am very happy to John Wick I love you Mr Wick this is a well put piece, esp. with excerpt piece from Siberia... ""On your hunts, does a bear ever escape?"" as a response to the question on Chptr 3 ""How far can he get?"" making more room to for us to wonder about Chptr 4 in sense of an idea of ""how far he can get""... and that\'s him in Chptr 3 \'a hunted bear\', resurrected in Siberia \'escaped bear\'... but only if Siberia came after Chapter 3, I think the idea would be even more great... especially to hang us on Chptr 4 suspense John Wick 4 top demais I love the this trailer, I never knew Agent 47 would be in this movie, OMG * I\'m being sarcastic btw*  pretty disappointed La mejor película There were parts of John wick Parabelum in there. And this is fan made. The word hyped cant describe what im feeling rn Going be bad ass  John wick is the film, where you feel like playing the deadly shooter.\nKill! Kill! Kill! Kill. I was watching Adelle one time on YouTube and I think I heard her mention something about wanting to work with Keanu Reeves, and I still can\'t wait for John Wick vs Fast and the Furious (to be set in Mexico >:D)(or John Wick vs Zombies) Donnie yen is meant to be in john wick 4 John wick Tamil Nadu fans  Maybe they\'ll just adopt this as the actual trailer. En la siguiente entrega, John pedirá ayuda a Mr. McCall (The Equalizer-Denzel Washington), John wick pondrá en orden los asuntos en N.Y y Robert McCall eliminará a los miembros de la alta mesa. ;) this happened me so much that 30 seconds in video i knew it was fan made, checked description and wow! it was fanmade!!!! bruh if theres more than 2 scenes in a trailer from that movies older episode, its fanmade Best fan made trailer I ever watched I think this part will be the epic of these adventure movie On God This is from Siberia, Hitman, Agnet 47 and john wick 1,2,3 Fun fact - Baba Yaga is not actually the same thing that boogyman. What if Keanu\'s dog steals Jason Statham\'s package, and Liam Neeson\'s daughter steals Keanu\'s dog, then they meet in Jackie Chan\'s restaurant? Yahooo can\'t wait for it!!! I\'m happy to see his dog again  He is the most humble actor in real life. But in film he is baba yaga This is fan made lmao, I think they said chapter 4 is delayed a year late (..yknow why) and is coming out mid-late 2022 He should hide in a large city. Think about it. Is a tree hidden best in a field or in a huge forest with all the other trees. I just noticed the hitman 2005 elevator scene and I was like WAAAIT A MINUTE At least try to have some movie scenes that actually Keanu is in. Pretty good FAN MADE! Damn can they fudgin get Gal Gadot  to join John Wick please!!!! That would be fucking awesome. every time i see the adjudicator I\'m seeing Gal Gadot LOL Capítulo 4 vai ser pika kkkkkkkkj So let\'s get Jason Bourne helping John wick in chapter 4. Go Adding scenes from his movie Siberia does not make it a John Wick Movie!!! Keanu Reeves has already made his John Wick 4... yet people still waiting on him to make his Matrix 4 Rebooted (they might call it that)... I think the most intense fight is john weak vs james band The elevator scene is from hit man he opens the elevator hatch and rains bullets on them with a stunning pair of 1911s wow pretty well put together Damn it, let me guess, will be in 2022? This is “fanmade” don’t be fooled If they don’t bring Cassian back in 4 it will be a travesty Heyecanla bekliyoruz seni jhon I hope this comes out next year Wikipedia says John Wick 4 AND 5 are being made, then coming out in 2022 & 2023. Cool. So we know he\'ll at least survive no. 4.   In 3 the hotel dude (sorry, I forget his name) betrays him at the end, or does he? I\'m curious to see where that goes. My fave movie  I didn’t know he was John wick in his other movie “Siberia”.... Quite easy to predict this storyline...John Wick will go to war with the High Table\'s and with the help of the Bowery and Ruska Roma (some other group will join him as most of them will want High Table\'s to be destroyed) once they beat the High Table\'s and John Wick be selected as the new leader in the new High Table\'s, he will go after Winston...he killed Winston and choose Charon as the new Continental boss... Damn I was really thought this was the one Until I read these comments No way someone could survive that fall much less being shot Actually this is scheduled to be released in May of 2021, they\'ll probably have \'John Wick V: Bury The Dead\' out by 2022 ... whoa is this real trailer ? is so realistic Lost my dog this week. Hope John’s survived. Looks. Amazing John wick 4  expected  to release in : May 27, 2022 \naccording to IMDB As soon as I saw clips from Hitman, I knew it\'s fake. We need Kong , The world needs him I think Matrix 4 and John Wick 4 will be connected. Morpheous is there too already! i love this movies ! Disclaimer:\n\nSome may say this is too much within a comment were as i feel im just scratching at the surface & passing on my honest opinions & ideas of what could be before its too late , as the topic matter of so many numerical follow up films released first before the prequel has been made & released has been done before & successfully but its rare to get 5 movies based on a particular character that has done so well that you want to see more until to finally get to see the prequel...  I like how they put scenes from Hitman in there haha As soon as I saw clips from Hitman, I knew it\'s fake. I never seen pit bull staying clam all the time  I never new they made a part 1. Awesome!!! Melhor sequência de filme de ação de todos os tempos I will pay $100 just to see 4 right NOW!!! I can\'t wait for J W chapter 4  Can\'t wait for the real J.W 4 I asked Johnny Silverhand and he said ""nah kid, its a fuckin\' fake"" Lmao, I recognized those scenes from Hitman. Great addition. Bela edição de imagens the fan who made this should work with keanu reeves hahaha Morpheus....We need you back Man! the sence when he get the gun out from the ice box is in Hitman film, i remember that Cecep Arif Rahman must be in this film.... on John\'s side. That name ""RESURRECTION"" is from Matrix 4,yeah,that\'s the official name now Can\'t wait. Love the dog. that\'s great cant wait...... Wick is a great actor Did u just put Agent 47 kill the special forces in elevator lol hahahah Incredible editing , Combined the movie old 47 and the new one .. Such a amazing This should be called trailer movie of ""Siberia"" starred keanu reeves   My gorgeous Keanu, my J Wick ,my magical perfect human , I love you and can’t wait to see your next adventure blessings to you,and I pray that you are well and safe,️️️️ Original Hitman feel there with the elevator and gun in ice footage. The Timothy Olyphant one. you did a fantastic job on this trailer. My parents saw John Wick 1-3 and they were. The scene on 0:58. Isn\'t that from the movie Hitman? I cant wait for another john wick movie.... so USA and TBS can stretch it over five hours with commercials!!! 1:05 its from Agent 47  This is a prime example why Youtube should not have taken away the thumbs down counter. ದಿ ಬೆಸ್ಟ್ ಮೂವಿ  When you dont put fan made in the caption but you want that juicy views I\'m curious if wick looks different in four. Because keanu shaved his head and beard for matrix 4. When will the 4 come out? Misleading. If it’s fan made, at least be honest about it... About half way through the trailer, I realized it was fan made. Thank God because the first half, all I was thinking was ""This is NOT a John Wick movie. If it is, it looks like crap"". John Wick has a certain flair to it and that wouldn\'t live up to the other 3 movies. Wick with the Kar98, he knew what the new meta was so he had to put it in his loadout. Watching till the end and after that read description said fan made trailer. Why dont write it on title. I really dont care watching fanmade trailer because sometimes, it was literally more fascinating then the real one. But, please be honest to viewers. Is this a real trailer clips of 1-3 put together? If not true excited for JW4 I CAN\'T WAIT bro i was so hyped but then saw FAN MADE ffs man All of this over a puppy and a pencil.  Hopefully, they will keep the trend up of having a larger body count than the previous movie. At 0:47 it literally has the RSF  attack hitman in hitman 2007 and at 1:01and 1:07 when he\'s running from the investigators and pulls 2 1911 out of a freezer in the same movie 1.00 that\'s agent 47 bro that ice cubes scene!!! It\'s because of the legendary DOG..  extremly waiting Misleading title.. the added clips are from his movie Siberia The best revenge series The way I clicked do damn fast I\'ve loved KR since Speed 1 :)) Covid 19 2022 de bitse bari sinemayı özledim. FAN MADE!!!!!WHAT!  Good job though..cause I got super  excited Bro they litterally just sended heavely armored soldiers just to kill 1 very slipery person Damn he’s still trying to escape the matrix Siberia and John wick mixed together  How come they added 2 clips from Hitman (2007) to this trailer? The clips were at 58 seconds to 1:02 and 1:06-1:07. I havent seen a ton of movies but couldnt have missed those. I love all the John Wick movies and the 2007 Hitman (all in my collection). Did anyone see any other clips from another movie in this trailer? As FMTs go, this was pretty fair! Still clickbait though, you naughty people. Looks like Donnie yen ( China martial arts ) will be in the next John wick series (John wick 4) Keanu es tan hermoso John Wick, THE GREAT writer :::: Derek Kolstad, I praise him. Yes, there are few people in India who are still trying to take revenge on corrupt intelligence and corrupt police and corrupt politicians, for destroying innocent lives of True people who fight for justice, to protect the poor and innocent. Absolutely three versions of JOHN WICK are true in real life like HITMAN and WANTED. the code might be different. ONLY true legends known as good intelligence in the system of every country can save JOHN WICK like people in the real world. It a good movie in my life I never forget. Because it is true in some lives of India. I mean it’s nice concept but this is fake trailer not as enticing as other chapter previews debe de estar bien melo, uff, esta pelicula en verdad va a ser una guerra total de asesinos Should be John Wick 4: The Baba-yaga He kills with the pencil!!! Excited for next year Adding hitmans agent 47 shots on the fake trailer nice boi Ignoring the fact this is fan made btw\n\nSo Obviously they are going to make a 4th movie, that much is obvious by the cliffhanger in #3, but how the hell do they escalate the conflict in this story further than they already have? We\'ve gone to John Wick chasing a Russian kingpin, to John Wick chasing a member of the High Table, to John Wick chasing... the people trying to murder him? to now John Wick chasing down EVERY SINGLE member of the high table. What\'s next, we reveal that there is a secret crime Illuminati 1 step higher than the already overthetop High Table that John Wick is going to have to track down? And also, they are going to have to find some excuse to bring Wick\'s kill count up to 400 in this next one btw. Why the clickbait title? ""Fanmade"" needs to be in the title. I wish this will be 5hrs length \n\nAmen What movie was Keanu in where he is in the snow shooting people with the rifle, that actually looks really good unlike this fan made trailer. It’s called Siberia. Top de mais The real cyberpunk 2077 temperance mission is here When will the fourth season of the movie air? YouTube very lame indeed for not making sure to labeling it \'concept\' or \'unofficial\'!!\n\nThumbs down.. especially, the trailer itself making the \'John Wick\' character looking less combative/confident! LAME! But the pretty little face of the cute pitbull puppy is the redemption. ""While hunting, did the bear ever escape from you"". I just don\'t like broken English guys:) Trigger point is a good new movie for now until next John Wick muy buena hacer un corto con dos john wick y siberia Amazing Jhon wick... When did the Hitman got hired to kill Boogeyman ""Ат тебья я кагда нибыть убигал?"" I dont care if it is a fake trailer , the most important thing is john wick is back ! When is the real trailer for John wick 4 coming out. Si vis pacem,\nPara bellum. I would like to see ""The Dog"" In action in this part The whole comments section: Fan Made!\nMe: I don’t really care this is what happens when Vincent/Valerie gives Johnny Silverhand full access to his/her body :/ это фильм Сибирь, а он играет перекупа алмазов, дешевый сценарий, еслиб не Киану то даже не смотрел бы его I’m still throwing up at how bad  JW3 was. Plot twist: John Wick is actually Neo and these 4 movies have been the MATRIX sequels... That dog better be ok by the end of it all. Ini yang ditunggutungu Ahhhh... Someone liked my idea of ""The Resurrection""... seriously? just added siberia movie scenes with some john wick 3 clips Я ни слова не понял что сказал Киану по русски... Morpheus trying to show neo another door again If you watch closely they used two scenes from the movie hitman relased in2007 \nThe elevator scene and the scene where 47 draws his ballers from under the ice cubes தமிழ் நாடுதான் ரொம்ப வெயிட் பண்ணுது  I knew something was up with this trailer when I saw the pulling the guns from the ice machine scene from Hitman (2007). You only mixed JW3 and Siberia scenes... nothing to do with  JW4. John Wick: Chapter 4 (2022) ⮘ f\'u\'l\'l M\'o\'V\'i\'E ⮘\n➲ https://bit.ly/2REnCP3\n\nAll Subtitle JESUS CRISTO abençoe a todos.. Çıksada izlesek artık özledim John Wick Lan bu skik fragman nasıl 10 milyon izlendi. Sibirya ve JW\'nin diğer serilerinden kesinti alınarak yapılmış xDDD picking guns from ice box and the elevator , looks familiar from Hit Man movie. isn\'t it? Трейлер липа, вырезки из 3 и 2 частей фильма + вырезки из фильма Хитмен Más Dios muestra su amor para con nosotros, en que, siendo aún pecadores, Cristo murió por nosotros, dice Jesús: El que oye mi palabra, y cree al que me envió (Dios), tiene vida eterna; y no vendrá a condenación, más ha pasado de muerte a vida.\n\nEl juicio de Dios sobre la humanidad se acerca, estos son los ulitmos tiempos y el Señor vendrá de nuevo a establecer su reino en la tierra,tan cierto como que yo vivo dice el Señor, toda rodilla se doblará ante mí, y toda lengua confesara a Dios, arrepiéntete de tus pecados pídele perdón a Dios por ellos, acepta a Jesús como tu Señor, guarda sus mandamientos como consecuencia de esa fe y tendras la vida eterna.

Did anyone noticed Hitman movie scene on 1:01 Sus escenas de Hitman 47 jajaja, y de las dos películas This is clearly a ""fan made"" trailer Atleast add ""Fanmade"" along with the title, And also if you are going to make a John Wick Trailer then why are there scenes from another movie (Hitman). Trailerda gördüğüm kadarıyla hitman 1 ve 2 deki sahnelerden esinlenmekten çok çalmışlar. Trailer ortasından sonra hitman izliyor gibi oldum bir an. Batman vs 007 vs john wick movie has to happen You hurt my feelings man Denle atención, tiene hambre. Esa película no es John Wick Good job Hahahaaa what a joke\n\nBut nice video you got skills  00:56 so we get 2 more movies , yeaaah !

And no that\'s not a compliment Full editing and scenes of hitman are also there It\'s fan made bro, that pistol in the fridge with ice cube scene is from Hitman, lol The Neo-Morpheus comeback BabaYaga️  1:03 this Hitman. And full movie from another parts of John Wick. There are scenes from hitman in there definitely not official and scenes from Siberia I thought this was real and legit not fan made and I’m not trying to be negative I’m just stating facts and I’m not saying my opinion matters but I want to give you feedback on what I thought, so if you think it’s a negative try to look at it as a positive in some way Porra, tem até cenas do Hitman kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk I\'m not reporting this video for misleading me, consider this a professional courtesy It’s FANMADE️\nBut fuck.. It was a good video.. John Wick 4 - with a fucking  Well still good work man..

But with the title of resurrections, it reminds me of another trailer. Fena film Do what you do best Hunt WHEN JHON FALLS OF THE BUILDING IT WAS SO UNSATISFYING MAN Matrix 4 = John Wick 4   ️️️ Omg️️️ Esto me prende :v Why couldn\'t they see this is basically the Matrix 4 as well ? Not bad if there were not so many scenes from Hitman in it lol I believe some of these scenes we from the movie Siberia. nice i thought it was real ahhh fuck its suppose to be John Wick 4 trailer but most of the clips are from The Hitman and Hitman agent 47 he need now pen in part 4 A few scenes were taken from Hitman, ok :D Some clips were came from his movie Siberia Yeah I\'ll wait till the actual trailer is released.

Dejelon vivo es mi idolo sheeeeeesh fafa keanu is back Fuck it\'s fan made.......\nWhen i saw the mosin i was really excited so i looked down in the comments 1:00 & 1:07 are hitman movie scenes once jhon wick shot a bullet to space \nnow its called moon I need John Wick nr ? , about how John became best assassin , how he killed Bogeyman,  how he fix impossible task for Viggo Superb john wick wearing that coat is Siberia not John Wick 4 Oh it\'s going down I like JOHN WICK GET OUT THERE KEANU Didn\'t put ""FAN MADE"" JUST to earn views I think some hitman scenes are stollen in this trailer Loved 2 and 3 but this looks a bit  litterally the hitman movie but 47 is john wick Cuts from JW 1, 2, 3, Siberia, Matrix... This was a waste of time, they crossed scenes of all John wick movies and to make it worse...the movie ""Hitman"". It\'s fake... Also combines scene from the movie ""Hitman"". \n\nFrankly, we feel cheated when these mean guys do anything like that. I\'m john wick  شوكت يبدي الجزء الرابع ممكن نعرف I gotta say it\'s fake but a really well made fake trailer like well done Is the movie John wick available in hotstar? Who all came here from matrix Resurrection ️  Hitman = John wick XD haha Wait, i saw scene take 2 gun, it\'s like hitman scene  This doesn\'t feel like fan trailer Who recognized a hitman  sense Half of these scenes are from hitman movies Why is there a scene from “Siberia” included?

John Wick Needs Nobody You killed john dog yeah hes gonna be here in 5 4 3 2 1 and see you in the afterlife John Wick chews the bees and spits the honey Hitman movie scene was there!  This is not jonh wick...is just parts on a different movies I realise too this man seems to be aggrwssively selling this move holding t-shirt of movie name sake to promote it in and even to the extent of connecting people on FB asking to buy fan card to call his agent Ted Toback in hollywood.  Does this man have the other bad side of him? really tired of fan made... Wtf agent 47 moment? My friends laugh at me When will the film go down and God is entitled and God is the best movies followed by John Wick NEMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ️ 1 2 3 and 4 !! too much ... What the fuck?...

HITMAN 2007 Elevator scene 0:58 How is this fanmade ?? My best forever Im waithing to keanu full andernaline misleading title that\'s a fan-made This is ""SIBERIA"" not john wick... نزل ف السعودية او لا  متى ينزل ؟؟؟ Cool  where i can see chapter4 ? Wrong,this isnt a real trailer. Obviously couldn\'t be true. A 4 month old movie trailer of a movie  that just started shooting. Maybe 3 weeks ago... so what do we think is gonna happen to dog this trailer is funny,stupid,kind a making me angry at the sam time. I think you conffused the numbers, what about chapter Portobello Killing strangers... Nice video Like this video for 10 years good luck (Don\'t risk getting bad luck - like it now) They should make a movie where John wick’s story begins. Ansiosa pra ver esse filme.\nQuê ótimo!!! Seria genial que hicieran una pelicula que trate de sus origenes,de como jhon wick se fue formando hasta combertirse en el increible asesino hasta ahora i wish we survive from corona virus to see john wick 4.. Amo esse filme dms Would\'ve been interesting to see his early life when he went by the name of Jardani Jovonovich at Ruska Roma under the tutelage of the Director and then starting his career as a hitman. Seeing him working for Viggo Tarasov and watching him fulfilling the impossible task that allowed him to leave. \nThen again, maybe a spin off series with a few seasons would better showcase his enter life. Lo mejor de lo mejor, me encantan las películas de John wick, no veo la hora que salga en cines Mal posso esperar. O Keanu tá mais gato ainda. E mais vingativo. O filme promete. Amo o Jonh Wich. Sem dúvidas o sucesso do momento. Awesome I can’t wait to see the next chapter in the John Wick trilogy!!! Who else saw the ending of John wick 3 and was like surely there’s gonna be a 4th film 😂 They should make a “Babbayaga” prequel about the “impossible task”that got him out of the game John wick Has to be one of the best sequels in movie history I\'m really looking forward to watching this amazing Chapter 4! I love john wick. Can\'t wait for his past to be a movie Let\'s just be honest. We are expecting a gun that fires out tons of pencils in John Wick 4. I\'m so ready for this. I am particularly ready for the romance John finds in this movie. Show, show e show, vou querer assistir com certeza..... Essa saga vai ate a 8,👏🏻👏🏻 A friend of mine saw this trailer and thought it was real. Thats why I\'m here. It took a while to convince him it wasn\'t. Pretty well made. For all that we know, John Wick\'s car, which was gone for repairing in chapter 2 will be back in Chapter 4. The fight scene in John wick is really insane...waiting for 4 Such a good movie and awesome actors in it and hero is fully adapted and suited the character 😍😍😍 and i saw 3 chapters waiting for 4 th chapter Eagerly waiting for John wick 4 Bonita película John wick la primera mucha acción y muchos muertos felicito a Keanu Reeves por sus actuaciones d las películas q e mirado y ojalá q siga filmando películas d acción Uau... não vejo a hora! I wish there was a love button and not just a like button , I love john wick and Keanu reeves so much Tem uma cena no trailer que é de outro filme. A cena da granada. É do Assassino a Preço Fixo 2, com Jason Statham AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! QUE EMOCION John wick is the best movie ever ❤️ Si John Wick encuentra de nuevo el amor,y se venga ,es el mejor final para la saga.....todo empezó por amor y debe acabarse por amor....pero bien,ha sufrido y luchado demasiado,por eso dicen que de el que tiene una voluntad y una rectitud  inquebrantable.....sigue adelante sean cuál sean las consecuencias.....eso lo admiro,aparte de por ser el mejor tñy tan respetado In many ways john wick is like master yoda. both are shown in their boomer version as badasses but one could only imagine their might during their actual youthful prime. This franchise can maybe go on for a while . So much back story. Melhor filme de ação,esses de John wick I wonder if wick will actually take some of his killers wepons so he is always ready and it would be cool to see him drive a fast car with a shoot out maybe a big rig with a grenade launcher or a sniper rifle that would be cool can’t wait Estoy loco por ver la 4ta parte de jhon 🤩👍 Looking forward to seeing it ! Can\'t believe I have to wait for this movie until 2022. Hope it will be worth the wait. Why don\'t they just make thia a series. This movie is lit.💖 PRECISAM FAZER UM JOGO DESSE ATOR. I like how there’s scenes from other movies and older John wick movies in this “teaser” Can’t wait to see it. Excited for this part 🤘 As much i want to see what mr. Wick is going to do after parabellum.. but we as John wick\'s fans we need a separate movie and story about how\n Jonathan Wick became \nJOHN (THE BOGEYMAN) WICK  As much as I love the John Wick movies I hope the fourth one is the last one!😎 Wow....I can\'t wait : ) They need to make a movie where John Wick & the Equalizer meet up 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽 no one could play keanu reeves better than john wick ... 😀 This is what im waiting for..  n 1st day 1st show will go nowhere. 😍😍😍 Can\'t wait for this They won\'t never learn to leave Wick alone. Omg Love John Wick.... \nIm so Excited To See This I love John wick one of my favorite hit man movies Imagine if they cast Hugo Weaving to be the head of the high table and John\'s final enemy. Wow! That\'s freaking great! CAN\'T WAIT!!!!! I\'m a John Wick fan. I\'ve seen all 3 previous movies & can\'t wait to see the 4th one in May 2021 if Covid-19allows. Love this trailer The new John wick madly sounds dope Wow, he looks awesome in this one! Al Pacino to play John wicks father in John wick chapter 4 be a great addition to the cast Pretty much violence in John Wick franchise, but I love Keanu in any movies......❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I think they should make a prequel where john wick is still an active hitman, how he met his wife, how he ended up working with vigo, and how and why did he become an hitman Tráiler impresionante Vi la trilogía, me gusto la primera película, no imagino cuánto infierno se puede desatar en la cuarta parte... Quando será o lançamento? I want to let the John wick movie makers to make on John wick past life how he gets all to this stories since he is a man with a past. Met his wife how he is trained to be an expert assassin. ♠️♣️🎬 I just watched 10 minutes of trailers for five movies that are all part twos or fives or six for that matter and the only problem is there\'s no release dates can\'t wait for them to come out!! 😎✌️ Very exciting\nIm expecting this movie will be 2 parts\nIts gonna be an all out showdown hahaha I\'m waiting 🔥🔥🔥🔥 This movie looks sick! Sólo quiero ver la parte en donde entra Donnie Yen a patear la puerta y salen todos volando. 😎😎😎 I wish John wick can survive from Covid-19 so that he can put an end to the movie! This drops the same day as Matrix 4 🎉 Es hermoso I would love to see John Wick vs Predator. Lindo jonh Wick ♥️ John Wick 4 will be Awesome ! I just wanna see the other member of high table vs John Wick alone They should make a john wick movie  about the high table, like how the society started and how john got in and out, and back in there mess when they put out trailers like this it feels like most of the film is done but the release date is whole year away! god damn we got a treat with john wick, and it becoming a series of movies is ev en better They should do 3 prequels and 3 more sequels\n\n1.

Apparently they\'re doing john wick 4 and 5 back to back. Maybe a 2 part finale??? I hope your doing well jay 🙏 great.  with the 4th chapter incoming,  there should be a sequel of his origin""Where his story begins"" on how he became "" Babayaga "" Good now with part of the matrix crew back together we should see some cooler newer guns and more car stunts and the plot twist is that Jhon must fight his girlfriend to save her or both of them and then we should see the next wick series with one of the homeless guys who is as much of a gold assassin as wick Este no es un trailer oficial, habia una escena que jamas olvidare de la pelicula el mecánico The 3 who said Mr wick it\'s been an honour. Will be there beside him. May 27, 2022??? Another year of waiting, hope i\'m still alive at that time, my goodness i\'m very excited comes that date!!!

I\'m falling in love again with John wick someone else xdd Since my resurrection I am considered to be a God! It would be awesome if john wick has a silver hand!!!! They should have brought Hallie back and I thought this would be revenge back from the last John Wick 3 Nicely Done! I clapped for half hour after watching jhon wick part 3 John wick 4 coming soon\nJohn wicks dog: aw bark here we go again What if John Wick is who Neo dreams he is in the Matrix? did he just became even more younger? Ah that Quantum Sonata! They should also include somewhere in the story a younger brother just getting into the business 🤔 I can\'t wait Скоро как в Форсажах, потянет их на жёсткую фантастику. Первые части - полноценные боевики, далее:""А чтобы нам ещё такое высосать из пальца?!!!"" I am exciting for this part Haha bet y’all didn’t see the underworld clip in there😂 if they do not connect john wick 4 with the event of john wick 3, it would be a HUGE  dissapointment.

Unfortunately, Keanu Reeves is on him way to becoming Tom Cruise, neither of them can ever die. BUT WHO WAS THE MURDERER ? WAS IT THE KILLER OR JOHN WICK ? movie theaters are not open now...so I wonder if this is still going to happen? I\'d love to see any movie with Keanu Reeves guess if I cant see a new one, I\'ll check out other ones..even if I have already seen them...he is amazing at what he does...wish I could have the chance to be in a movie...I think it would be a great experience...so many people ""recognize me"" even tho I\'ve never met them....I should be in movies too I think lol eagerly waiting mr jhone wick ... Damn got add this to my collection!! Indeed indeed They should go to teenage John wick and bring him forward just before meeting Helen. This is more believable than the first bloody result that comes up when you search the John wick 4 trailer. But I don\'t even think this is the official trailer.

Your videos are absolutely incredible you are a very talented person. Why don’t you actually work in CGI in Hollywood Keanu Reeves is so Fine🥰 melhor filme do mundo حقيقة من اجمل الافلام التي شاهدتها When will it come out? Damn, I thought it was real! How about a movie about Vigo\'s impossible task given to JoHn.? JW recovers from his injuries ➡ someone helps him ➡ high table continues to hunt him ➡ they send a bunch of assassins to kill him ➡ insert random actor/actress to wage war against him ➡ lots of violence + awesome display of shooting and knife skills and martial arts skills ➡ JW comes out victorious 🔚 Wew, is this true?

Dương Quá ca ca 👏 John Wick is the Best movie\'s out there..He is more handsome now that he\'s older..\nLike fine wine...Ur a manly man..a man\'s man..\nVery SPECIAL one of a Kind.

Jurassic World Dominion,"['LLFSNWU8yx8', 'QrkxWavkD44', 'lVYwe2htD-s', '7QOd91vtYaM', '78serG6sLEs']","['Jurassic World Dominion Damn dude, you work fast! Great work  Fan made trailers are good as long as you say thery\'re fan made in the title The way Grant is introduced in this trailer is exactly what I wish to see in the real trailer/movie...Him maybe living on some kind of farm, hearing those velociraptor noises at night and immediately arming himself. Brilliant! At this point I can\'t even trust movie trailers anymore\n\nBut respect nevertheless for making it actually look realistic Mi infancia mi joventud marcada por los dinosaurios <3 Looks pretty good! Almost redeemed the scummy act of putting ""Official Trailer"" in the title when this is just a fan made concept video. The word official has no place in this title, I think we can all agree. Opa!!! Legal, sou fã do JP e se Deus quiser, verei com certeza! Que chegue junho de 2022.  Really good job making this! I always wondered how Alan’s ptsd would be! Thanks man! Don’t generally like these kinds of fan trailer but! Yours is pretty wicked  I can\'t wait to see the real trailer of Jurassic world Dominion Yesssss! I love the whole Jurassic Park series This looks so good if this was a real trailer I\'d definitely watch the movie I would love to see more allosaurus, it’s my favorite Dino and I feel like it should get more credit for what it was. Love this fan trailer. If only it was real... You cant put ""official"" in the title when it isnt, this is literally a fan made trailer muito emocionante! i love the fact that dr. grant armed himself with a shotgun in this just like in the first movie where he also used a shotgun to shoot the raptors. This is literally the best fan made trailer I’ve ever seen, hands down Can\'t wait for it! I\'m excited  I am so excited for this movie the danger is so much more and I remember that camper clip from the internet from awhile ago , where they showed the Dinos  attacking a camp site . Thats a damn good fan teaser. You dont get as many good fan trailers as this now. Also, please put ""Fan"", ""Fanmade"", or ""Concept"" in the title. Can\'t wait to see they actual real trailer for the Movie in 2022. I really like this and it gives me a good idea on what the movies gonna look like. Sam Neil is who I always think of regarding any Jurassic movie!! So pumped he’s in this!! I was so excited when I seen this up, thinking ""no way, it can\'t be"" but that was really fooking good editing and deserves a like and a comment. That took time, well done I\'m following ya as well. Legend This looks dope they bringing back the ogs from the regular Jurassic park  this gonna sell really good This is an amazing fan trailer, I\'m surprised it\'s not official. Great work. Can you please just put “fake” in the thumbnail?\nMany people might think this is real. Can’t wait to watch this when it comes out! This is nostalgic. This reminds me of the days in 2007 when i was little and i used to watch fake trailers for ""jurassic Park 4"". Looking forward to this movie! Ya quiero que salga jurassic world: dominon All I know is that the I can’t wait! Seriously I’m a giant Jurassic park and world fan and I cannot wait for this my man!!! This looks awesome, great job After 5 movies they finally show the container again! This is so exciting! Muito bem aditado parabéns I saw the cast members and Alan grant is back so I almost cried It would be cool if the original cast did all return for this movie. Man the thought of Alan having PTSD from the velociraptors is darl yet interesring Yessssssss i hope this series never die Ya quiero ver esta película estoy emocionado  I can\'t wait to see I\'m a huge fan of the series DUDE THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE THE REAL TRAILER!!! NOICE JOB! I really like the plot description you added for this fan-made trailer One of the best fan made trailers I\'ve seen!!! going to be a blast when it comes out Esta super genial el trailer I wonder if they will make a hybrid with of course blue, maybe the rest of the indoraptor syrum, and the barayonx they had in the cage. WE ARE SO CLOSE TO 2022 OMG. What I would like to see in Jurassic World 3 is Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum, and Chris Pratt working together, bring back dilophosaurus, spinosaurus, and connects to jurassic park part 2 and 3 and mix of practical effects and cgi I like how they showed Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler at the start. Now the official Jurrassic World: Dominion prologue is realeased!!! 1:17...esta escena es de una pelicula llamada ""historias para contar en la oscuridad"" por si les interesa la pelicula Best trailer EVER! I’m such a fan of dinosaurs and jurrasic world, i’m obssed with them! Can’t wait for 2022 Jun 10! This was a great unofficial trailer.  This still got me excited even though this is not actually it C\'mon man u can\'t say this is not real it just looks good already...can\'t imagine the real one Oooh I love this trailer! This trailer is pretty epic. Cant wait for the real trailer this fan made look already epic! Can\'t wait to see the real trailer I was shocked that I haven\'t seen this before, it was literally impossible that I being such a JP fan didn\'t noticed. Then I read the comments... Não vejo a HR desse filme sair tô loca pra assistir\n\nI can\'t wait for this movie to come out I\'m crazy to watch Cool! This really hyped me for the movie! This was soo good, I thought it was real for a second. extra! I can not wait! This is my BEST favorite movie. I am waiting impatiently and start watching the fifth part  Looks good but I’m really waiting for the real Trailer to come out Great work on the trailer it\'s amazing Can\'t really wait! This is so good it made me cry  Yay, It’s Nice to see Alan again!! this seems pretty real to me... other than the clips from I.D: Resurgence and reused FK scenes.. this was very well done Great trailer man 10 out of 10 Melhor trailer Cant wait for the movie wanna see the characters in battle at big rock in the movie 1:32  Quand on pourra enfin retourner au cinéma pour voir ce film, les acteurs seront comme celui-là I ALREADY KNOW ITS GONNA BE MY COMFORT MOVIE. Since the dinos and Blue were saved from the eruption of the volcano on the fictional Isla Nublar and they were all freed after the murder of the Indoraptor, the mercenaries and Eli Mills, Blue will return in Time Shift and she will guide all the dinos of all species from all the films they originally starred in and the ones that look like those still toys I snapped to safety from another volcanic eruption; Timmy Nysalt (Michael Bird), Jennis Thundorns (Veronica Taylor), Megalo Station (Blaire Rastaneo), Stefano Fornaciari (Martin Short), Bethany Shriram (Priyanka Chopra), Gavin Catheus (Sebastian Stan) and Jamie Michelle Luther (Tessa Thompson) will also help out with Diantholeerum to lead them to safety. After that, they will all be shipped for the mainland by another team of mercenaries lead by Mathias Headliner (Keanu Reeves) on a drive-rodded diesel freight train. Omg. I can not wait!!!!! I am the Jurassic Park/World #1 FAN.  I love It. I have watched the trailer about 52x. So Excited 6/2/22. Be there or be Square Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Jurassic world - 2015\nJurassic world : fallen kingdom - 2018\nJurassic world : Dominion - 2022 - I am Waiting  Just replace “official” with “fan made” and mwah chefs kiss, beautiful Can\'t wait for the Jurassic World Dominion! I feel like if the dinosaurs reached the mainland the military would take full control in order keep the people safe. Probably the best Jurassic park/world film yet Dude I\'m so exited I cant wait I know this is going to be a good movie Looking very forward for it to come out part because since I was a little kid I loved studying about dinosaurs, and in my early teens the first film Jurassic park came out, I was hooked on this franchise ever since :) secondly this film Dominion  was partially filmed on my island Malta even though during Covid the main actors did not come here to film. God can\'t wait till its out so exited. I\'m the #1 fan of Jurassic World and Park while I was suckered into watching this the scene of grant going to the window with a gun when he heard raptors would be a really cool scene I think I have no idea why I kind of want to cry when I learn that alan grant will be returning in jw3 When are we actually gonna get a real trailer for this movie Loool this is pretty well done, almost got me for a minute  There\'s no way the embryos would still be any good. Dodson said in the first one they would only last 36 hours in the canister cooling chamber. But trailer looks good anyways. 楽しみすぎる。クレアとオーウェン早くみたい〜 This looks really convincing I think this would be a good trailer\n\nWow I\'ve never seen so much likes on a comment of mine thx so much guys FINALLY!! Someone who uses this soundtrack!! Universal need to hire this man! This is gonna be epic no doubt this actuallu looks pretty good, buy you could\'ve prevented such a big amount of dislikes compared to likes by just putting concept or fan made in your title instead of official, people don\'t like clickbait you know. All the clips of the carnos interacting with humans makes me think of the old tv show Terranova for some reason. But yoooo!! I\'m so stoked to see Dominion!! I\'m almost fell for it ....FR..!!!!! But Damn it.... When\'s the REAL Trailer coming up soon...?!?!?!?!?!?!? That was crazy  You might wanna put concept/fan trailer in the title. I know it’s in the description but it’s still misleading. Honestly is the average YouTuber  gonna check the description? Lol no. But beyond that’s it’s a decently made fan made trailer! Sam looks amazing. If he\'s in, so am I. If you could of kept it to those first 30 seconds you would of had me fooled. Great Job. So ready to see this movie soon The flashback to the first movie with the shaving cream can with the DNA ahhhhhh! It brings back so many memories I can\'t believe I am saying this.....but this was extraordinary! AMAZING TRAILER!!! I really hope the canister has of cream returns also I heard that Dotson is returning Cannot wait ! I love jurassic park 1-3 and jurassic world 1-3, i just love them Even though it\'s fan made. It looks real. All time favourite movie  Na increíble, mis dieces a este fan trailer FINNALY IVE BEEN WAITING I CANYT WAIT ANYMORE! Nicely made FAN made trailer, you can clearly see it\'s not an official one by quality between clips. Plus how they\'ve used clips of Jeff in other films. I like how you take teaser clips behind the scenes and put it into the trailer If blue finds and try’s to fight Owen Grady I will cry my eyes out or maybe a new Dino and then blue saves who ever is gonna be in the movie it’s one of these theories everyone who sees this comment remember it Amazing trailer concept. This is the trailer we need. I had this trailer in mind but I don\'t have that talent of making those videos. Nice trailer. Its an unsung art to create two minutes of hype without lying about substance. Youtube needs a dislike button for videos like this 1:57 my favorite part and yea I am def buying a ticket to watch this I hope to see Nigel marven In Jurassic world dominion. It be so awesome seeing him come face to face with dinosaurs just like he did in chased by dinosaurs and prehistoric park .  I’m super excited for the final Jurassic World movie Had me in the first half ngl  Damn. This is really good. You\'ve outdone yourself. Had me going til the jurassic Park 1 voice-over  Instead of having a fake trailer, put a real trailer right away ; -; Man I just can’t wait to see the sixth movie  of Jurassic world and this is going to be great  This is really good for a fan made trailer All respect it is a good fan trailer and I got to see good parts from the first movie but try to include the other movies together because they play a good role to but thank you for your hard work That was the best fan Made Trailer i have ever seen A moment of silence for those that think this is the real trailer... Oblivious Child: Mom, why is there a dinosaur on the lawn?\nMom: MY PLANTS! I love too see Lewis Dodgson and Dr. Ellie Sattler from The humans, and the Velociraptor, Deinonychus and Utahraptor from The Animals. Finally I found a good trailer please God, let him have the spinosaurus, hopefully he does. I hope it\'s on the sorna island Lmao I love how the star wars-esque chime gave it away It’s well edited and looks like a great trailer\nBut I have to downvote you since you put official in the title, it’s just false information, put fan made there instead\nAt least you put it last in the description I guess, but still. Not everyone reads the description. The world’s most villain is nedry’s friend Soo upset I found out this was fan-made. Should have noticed the video quality giveaway, but thought my internet was playing up haha. \nThiss is fucking immaculate work <3 MY FAVOURITE CHARACTERS ARE BACK YEYYYY This is so good! Official and Fan Made have two very different meanings Legendary casts also joined... this will be the best after Jurassic park 3 I\'m SUPER Happy that Sam Neill is gonna be in this movie! Him and Chris Pratt are my favorite actors! Can’t wait to see this movie i like how the dude hearts every comment except the ones calling him out. What\'s so sad is that if this scenario played out in reality, man would wipe away these dinos back into extinction quicker than you could say ""life......um....um....finds a way"" Holy marry mother of joseph, that looks so real Im excited!! This is the best but also sad why this is the final movie of a franchise we love You see a fan-made trailer\n\nIt’s actually good 1:17\nThat is actually real footage because there will be a scene where the T-Rex crashes into a drive-in cinema while being pursed by a military chopper. It looks awesome Tan bonito que se ve  I can imagine it playing out someway like this This is solid, but I can\'t stand when people label something as official when it\'s so obviously not. It plays viewers for a fool, but not just that, it also undermines the hard work you put into making this. Guarantee, you wouldn\'t have those 5k dislikes if you\'d just been honest. But hey, you got the views you wanted, so there it is. I’m gonna watch this new movie straightaway when the official trailer drops im gonna lose my shit. Yaaasssssss!!!!!!! Can’t WAIT!!!!!! And now here comes the legion of dinosaur  villains HOLY CRUD HOW IS THIS SO GOOD FROM A FAN HOW!?!!? Great to see Dr. Grant back in business)))) i love the trailer Gives me memories Ngl it was scary but i loveee it ! Great  trailer! you can always tell fanmade trailers, its always the audio mixing, thats the sure way to tell. ive heard worse though This is what we want very nice  Much better than the first preview after the one from F9 0:25 love how thats a gopro of a car falling off with a dinosaur edited in Until the day comes where we have the power to take these wonderful creations away from there creators and save them from fates like JP3\nI cant support fan made trailers but I hope to one day. why is it not out yet cant wait any longer but great trailer really!!!!! When the  real  trailer ????!!!! I\'m happy to see doctor Grant in some more comfortable clothing. Imagine if this wasn\'t fan made Why did I think this was a real trailer for the longest time?????  Excellent.  Where did you get all that new footage for the trailer? I’m so excited Excellent, My brother, yo see again the cast dra Ellie, Dr Grands and Ian, great! God I cannot wait!!!! Should\'ve called it Jurassic World War and had it be a movie about Humans blowing up dinosaurs Wow that barbasol can managed to survive 29 years  Nice great job on the fan made trailer. There should be an official trailer soon I hope but liked this Well I’m still very confused is this the real trailer or concept? It looks so real to be a concept If you didn\'t know, by putting ""Official"" In your trailer just isn\'t right, JUST ADMIT IT\'S A CONCEPT IN THE TITLE NOT IN DESCRIPTION As a hooray that It\'s not just Indy who is call a parent when she isn\'t actually This is gonna be bad ass!!!! this is just amazing so excited personally I can\'t wait It would be cool if Billy Brennan was in here Will blue be in this I hope so when a child wants to attract attention by trying to make room for himself using social media, he also invents a trailer with scenes from all the films. ashamed failed Damn that was incredible but I know that was fan made This is really well done for a fake! Where are some of the footage coming from I don’t recognize a few of those? Like the t Rex and the little triceratops looking one I. Can\'t. Wait!! Dude what version of the Jurassic park theme did you use? This is epic! I can’t wait Dont call it official man, thats just deceiving my guy To be honest, fans exaggerate the Lost World errors and, yes, Jurassic Park 3 had a fantastic story thrown out the window by a shitty director, but the PARK franchise is far superior to the WORLD franchise which started off fun, exciting and....Ok. Jurassic Park, to this day, is fun, Exciting and amazing. The Lost World may have a corny Godzilla ending, but the rest of the film is actually quite good, while Fallen Kingdom fails miserably and even makes Jurassic Park 3 look amazing in comparable. Oh YES! I truly believe rollercoaster, cheap JP3 is superior to shitty I-Don\'t-Know-How-Any-Of-This-Makes-Sense, non-scary, non-jumpscare Fallen Kingdom. The events and story makes about as much sense as trying to build a skyscraper from rooftop to basement. JP was perfect...minus Dilophosaurus. I don\'t CARE how ""Cool"" the frills look, even if it is poisonous it makes no sense to evolve them if you are hunting. If anything they\'d be for mating or trying to scare off larger predators. Why would it pop up when spitting and spook the prey into running when without it the Dilo looks harmless (That alone is a lure to other shorter predators). It\'s a totally useless waste of dino flesh and exists solely to humor the director\'s ignorance and arrogant lack of understanding on what a dinosaur is and how they are not lizards. No offense to Spielberg, but his knowledge of dinos come from the 1920\'s. What did you think? That Cobras have them cause they are venomous? Cobra\'s don\'t have frills cause they are venomous, Steven, it\'s cause they are DEFENDING themselves by WARNING predators that it IS venomous and not worth the risk. It says, ""Stay away! I will poison you in self defense. Don\'t try it! There are easier meals elsewhere."" The frills never looked like they belong there anyways. They look out of place, which they are, and rather silly now. Having said that, you take off the frills and to THIS DAY, Dilophosaurus is the MOST realistic looking dinosaur in the ENTIRE franchise. He\'s actually there and is too damn detailed into realism including bird-like movements. And, also to this day, no dino after has looked as real to me. Oh, and speaking of realism, why JP3 dinos looked a little odd, they were still identified, while the Fallen Kingdom dinosaurs didn\'t even look like their species, they looked like random dino plastic toys. You know, the ones you find cheaply made at the supermarket and used to beg mom and dad to buy it for you when you were five! Hell, the film producers realized it too. They hired a paleo-artist and actually payed attention to him when they did The Battle at Big Rock allosaur. And it looks amazing, mind you, unlike Fallen Kingdom Allosaur that no one knew or identified as an Allosaur, though it did look like some imaginary wacky dino from the 1980\'s Denver, The Last Dinosaur! lol I do hope to enjoy this upcoming Dominion film even though I already KNOW it will never live up to the first film or even second film, but it does have producers wanting to make them more as they more truly looked like even though they are still, as Spielberg MADE them contrary to his beliefs, Hollywood Monsters. I know it\'ll be fun as well as partially weak. Bill I don’t think that shotgun is gonna do much Living animatronics of all the Jurassic Park/Jurassic World dinosaurs will be suitable for the Universal theme parks. I like Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Isabella Sermon, Justice Smith and Daniella Pineda. If they don\'t bring back spino, I am going to scream Is Alan Grant really in this? I hope.. I like this work of art. Amazing trailer man Ok the first part looks legit but the rest is bull from the previous movies and....is that a scene from Jason borne?? It\'s about time to get the band back together man lmao A good plot twist that should happen:the plesiosaurus comes back!! I’m so ready That was great! OMG, my childhood heroes are back... Dr. Alan Grant, Dr. Ellie Sattler & Dr. Ian Malcolm Why are there so many concept trailers?! It\'s so hard to find the real one! Looks hella good THIS LOOKS GREAT!!!!!!!!! Fan made trailers make errors, althou some scenes are from the official, the can from JP1 isnt. We all know rexie stomped that thing during the desperate escape of mr. harding and the mother of ian\'s soon to be adopted kid kelly (Yes, this is the story why sarah asked ian to basicaly adopt her, as her father was ASKED to take care of her (btw. we see exactly that harding already in JP1, he is the one threating the Trike). And yes, that game is part of the canon timeline Best fan made I ever seen And the  award for best acting , goes to : the Barbasol can.  Jurassic World 3 is coming out in June. Is this fan made? if it is than props to you  Looks soooooo good You got me..!! Great job  Welcome to Jurassic world  is this past in culmination or past culmination? imbeded in the rocks of what period, would it be safe to say that in nature would have differentiating in depiction, a collection that might lead to varied assertions? this particlar film expounds upon an animus imbed to philosophize as intermediate. is it however intermediate to our understanding of given species? Wow dinosaurs are now in city I love when it 2022 it start I always watch Jurassic Yo got me there this is fanmade isn\'t it We will be so proud of the person who took his DNA to ude AMAZING Best ever fan made trailer.. I think about 40-45% of this trailer was real, the rest was just from Fallen Kingdom and the short film This is also much better than the last one that music is so good Dude this is sick!! Caraca velho faz mais um trailer fritar demais spino, indomious and giga , they all went up against a t rex like can my homie rex just live in peace\n\nI also wanna see all 4 of those in one movie I\'VE LOVED DINOSAURS SINCE I WAS FOUR AN EIGHT YEARS LATER I AM SO HYPED TO HAVE THIS MOVIE OUT!!!!!!! PS. i know this is fake but you are the best at making that kind of shit. Num coloque ""oficial trailer"" quando não for oficial, você tinha que ter colocado ""fã trailer"". Wait a minute,is this trailer movie a fake or real?\nBecause I\'m not falling for that again. GOING TO BE EPIC  !!!!!!! Dr Grant my dear doctor satlor welcome to jurassic park Shark is no longer the ultimate sea predator. Poor thing Grant is shocked bc his nightmare has come back Don\'t call it Offical Trailer, when it\'s not! I just hope that the people who were in the first jurassic park are in jurassic world now (I mean there might be Lex and Tim, Dr. Elly and Grant and maybe Dr. Ian who is at the end of the fallen I hope in the film there is alan grant NICE!!!!!! can\'t be worse than fallen kingdom. nothing in this franchise could be worse.... could it? I wouldn\'t be pissed at you if you haven\'t faked it being real. Because that was really well made and believable Pretty good fan made trailer OH YEAH. Maisie is so going to Juvenal hall after this. I hate fan made trailers… but this was pretty cool Jurassic world : random clips of previous movies spliced together trailer! The Main 3 are backAwesome!! I love Chris ️ うわあ、、なんか怖い、、でも楽しみ️️️ This is really good for a fan made trailer It cool I enjoy it I want it to be the real trailer 쥬라기 공원 06: 지배 They should add Darius and his team.

Is this the real thing? Or fan made cuz if it’s fan made THIS IS AWESOME Great fan made trailer Thanks POKE REX for doing a trailer This is going to be lit Wow. This is going to be a massacre.

Welcome… to… Jurassic world Awesome fan trailer Oldies r back to face Dinos!!!  I like how u used it from a different movie but amazing like just amazing trailer The trailer might be clickbait but the move isn’t, it’s literally gonna release on June 10 next year. I’m a lil mad…why can’t they put my favorite person back on there….Doctor Allen grant It\'s good, could convince some people Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler are my fav actors It\'s coming out next year you got to be kidding me could come out the part with the red tin as a reference to jurassic park from 1993 Dinosaurs as the next super power Alan, ian and Ellie will return in the movie ️️️ This is why I read the comments before watching the actual video it saves my time Releasing a concept/fan trailer and calling it the  ""Official Trailer"" is sort of scummy mate. \n\nDecently done but I don\'t approve of the title. Vi Alan Grant ya viejo espero que regrese this doesn\'t look ""official"", there is blurry footage of what looks to be video taken while the actors were filming some scenes...why lie? I feel like crying\nTheres a movie called rams and thats were the alan grant teaser comes from\nSo its pretty rare he might actually go in the movie DO NOT PUT \'OFFICIAL TRAILER\' IN THE DESCRIPTION WHEN IT\'S FAN-MADE! Fantástico  In one Game....all the Dinos have a Gen, if its getting activated they gonna die....wonder if the movie ends like that I am so excited Here\'s a pro tip: Don\'t title your videos as official trailers when it\'s clearly fan made chuckle head. If this was a fan made trailer, how did thay use real life people to act in the trailer? we gotta wait till 2022… Se ve epico Get\'em Dinosaurs. After the first movie, I started rooting for the dinosaur.  All humans involved deserved to die after the first movie. When will it be on netflix Bro I love jurassic world/park movies Okay, firstly,  great trailer,  but there were some scenes that were from Fallen Kingdom,  like the one with Owen, Claire, and the pyteradons, as well as the Baryonx in the cage and the one with blue overlooking a neighborhood.... haha thats a good fan made trailer, they even threw in some independence day in there, and abit of youtube clips lol Damn this is fan made but the legendary maybe is busy making the official trailer cause the movie is delayed on covid-19 so we cant do anythin within even though the Jurassic world: dominion. Is really real i see it on HBO max OKay- I absolutely lov this trailer, they used most of the footage from teasers, and not stuff from different dinosaur franchises like walking with dinsaurs. Its great, but god dammit do Not say is oficial. I wouldve been way happier if u said fan made cus it was so dissapoitning This awesome!!! damn you bro.I trhought this was real. BUT great work with the concept its still amazing Is this official or just fan-made? At first i was like: How is the official trailer for this movie so bad….Then i came to the comment section That Scene with  Alan Grant  And Ellie Sattler go in to the plane is real set photos of the movie If it\'s a fan made trailer, say so. Personally you shouldnt put ""Official Trailer"" in your Title,sorta Misleading even though You Written Concept/fan made Trailer in the Desc,But Never the Less,Outstanding Trailer Jurassic world is turning into a primal carnage 2.0 ️ you should really say that it’s fan made Yeah im gonna watch the shit out of this!!!!!! What\'s the Sam Neil film you use to make this? Looks quite good. I put 500 on it that when the real one releases it will not be as good as this trailer. This aint official cuz all of the scenes are from the other jw movies or different movies but respect the hardwork️️ To the untrained eye this be bad ass nice fan made trailer Is this the real trailer because I don\'t think it is\nEither way it\'s good Thats the actor that played Admiral Holdo in the Last Jedi, the hair was so similar! We will have a great time when the movie starts but in that soda can is dna  that will make it a lot more dagourus than the world will be there’s. This is going to br a badass movie people will praise u not scold u if just put fan made in title cause its really good Poor baby seratops made me cry a lot I\'ll wacth it tho looks cool the noise of the gun loading is a lot of the CS GO game from the old update even but I loved it Hopefully this one is accurate Sad the movie was delayed until next year I hope this is official Why’s it gotta lie to us like that, you can make a fan trailer but ya gotta say it’s fanmade Fake or not where did he get the footage for some\nOf the scenes? Só queria saber por que demora tanto pra lançar afs Good concept trailer It should have ended at first part. This is prob better than the actual trailer we will be getting and movie 1:17 that’s a scene from scary stories to tell in the dark Not bad, I actually thought it was real Dude pls put ""Fan-made"" trailer instead of ""official"" trailer next time, dope trailer tho. Is this really real\nIm a fan of jurassic but not one of those super nerd dino people \nWqit this looks like fallen Kingdom Ok in the scene giga vs trex that was a flashback 65million years ago you guys will si it in the movies  This will be the next Fast Saga\n2031: Jurassic Park 10 Dinosaurs  on Mars How is this slowly becoming planet of the apes all of a sudden lol Defiantly official nice amount of footage from old films I think this is really good but it shouldn’t have the word “official” in the title.\nIt’s straight up lying Well there will be a list of 6 movies. Jurassic Park trilogy & Jurassic World trilogy. It could be known as the Jurassic Saga. don\'t call it Official if it\'s fan-made Why did you call this an official trailer when it\'s obvious it\'s fanmade? What\'s the point? Welcome to Jurassic world that was so cool Yea, thought this was real until I noticed the jumpy frame skips, looked at the channel name and realized it\'s a fake trailer. Thought it was odd with the narration but not like actual real official trailers are much better, I suppose. I still blame the girl for releasing the dinos. this realllllll yesssssss im so happy dang cant there be one real trailer Amazing I DON\'T MIND FAN-MADE STUFF AND I ACTUALLY THINK IT\'S A GREAT HOBBY, BUT WHEN YOU LABEL IT EXACTLY LIKE THE STUDIOS DO OR EVEN PRIVATE CHANNELS DO WITH REAL VIDEOS AND TRAILER CLIPS?\nTHAT\'S CLICKBAIT... THIS IS FALSELY ADVERTISED.\nI do appreciate that there are some clips from the actual trailer but in a way that makes it even worse because you can\'t distinguish what\'s what! Not taking the jab (on trial until 2023) to see a movie. That guy was right welcome to Jurassic WORLD Oh shit...the shaving cream can...nice call back is this fan made because i saw footage from jurassic park and jurassic world 2. im a little confused we need a jaeger When this movie is releasing? 🇮🇹""""JEFF GOLDBLUM INVECCHIANDO SOMIGLIA SEMPRE DI PIÙ..A VITTORIO SGARBI""""!!!!! Not bad  kids think that having dinosaurs around would be great\nthey are not thinking that when they are chomped by aforementioned dinosaurs A dinosaur movie with lots of people and city but no much dinosaur. You really expect me to believe Spielberg made this??? Sit down bro before you hurt yourself. Great trailer, but I\'m also going to agree with literally everyone else. You need to change the title. Omggggg they\'re ending jurassic world!! Think about it. Jurassic park 1-3. Then jurassic world. Now in 3rd they are bringing everyone from the og films back. This the end of it  hopefully another series next ️️️ 1:59 : captain america: i get the reference 쥬라기 월드 화팅^^!!! Poor baby trike if that happens in the movie Dinosaur back to Dominion for\nround 2 Make the full movie  Yesss new movie be like this Seriously?! If I was going to make a concept trailer, at least say you made it and not say it was an ""official trailer"", don\'t you think? This isn\'t the official trailer its fan made so maybe put fan made trailer in the title because putting official is misleading and a little bit clickbait. Look children what\'s that sound, Everybody look what\'s going down... You need to state that this is fan made. Otherwise it\'s just click bait. I noticed all of the taken clips but well done bro. YO, this is real, I thought it was clickbait, never mind..... wait, never mind again???? clips from fallen, world, and some leaked footage, and some from another movie or show, and battle at big rock, a game and that\'s it???? this is so confusing yet it was a 2/5 star rating (the 2 for the new footage of our old friends from JP) Imagine not putting fan made Defiantly fan made I see a Jeff from independence day resurgence. He’s so cool You did a great job and I would have clicked thumbs up. But since you clickbait people by calling it an ""official trailer"" I have to give it a thumbs down. Sry mate, you are lying to people. kinda seems fanmade but its good anyway This is just mashed up footage of edited scenes from other films.  There\'s nothing official or related to JW3 in this.  So stupid. These scenes are from “Battle at Big Rock” on the Jurassic World YT site. And some of the scenes are from “Fallen Kingdom” this isn’t a trailer of the news JW Movies who’s coming in June 2022  You\'re efforts are appreciated but please don\'t mislead people by claiming you\'re official...clearly not Next thing you know they have Jurassic galaxy They had me in the first half not gonna lie i was thinking for sec that its real but ye its fake sadly You had me till the motorcycle ;) i know its fake but at least its well done What happened with the real jurassic park  You can’t say “official” and then say it’s a fan made concept, that’s not how shit works I thought this was real until I saw some stuff that didn\'t look right great work on the trailer but it is fan made I had a heart attack watching thid Why would you say ""Official Trailer"" when it\'s fan made? I\'m not angry, I\'m just disappointed. You must say that this is a fanfic clip in the tittle La escena de los coches es de una película que yo me vi - Dinosaurs back: we leave you guys for some few years and you fuck up the Earth  Shit Allen Grant is back hell yeah Vamoooooooooooooooooosssssssss!!!!!!!!!!! The last movie was kinda dumb now that I think about it \nThey literally went to save the dinosaurs and unleashed them on the world like bruh Dr. Grant!!!!!!!!!! Estou associou uhhhh quero assisti logo I want spinosaurus I know its fake but what movie is that very first clip from with Sam Neil with the gun? Awesome  does Sam Neil and the other lady ever age. Wonder why it says \'official trailer\'...since obviously this is fan made. A well made fan made....but still fan made. So its scummy in the long run. Trouxe os atores do filme original Even I know when something isn’t right and I’m dumb Cuando en cines Life finds a way - Ian maclom WHY YOU GOT ME THINKING THIS REAL THO We could have warned that this is a fan job.  Why the hell would anyone show a trailer a year out from release? I knew it was fake with Grant and Malcolm not even in the same car. Fool alot of tweens though. Who puts official trailer and HD in the same title.  It makes me irritated when trying to find the true trailer.  Not hating though I loved it :) I want my 43 seconds back Wait , is this real Jurassic World Dominion trailer? Ya se que es falso pero quería verlo jajaj  Me: bringing up a good point in an argument with my parents\nMy parents: 0:26 That surfer shot looks like a low budget bad cgi from 1990s Nothing\'s official here,but good work “In June 10”\nMe: stop the cap Nice but replace “Official” with “Fan-made” in the title Why does the trailer look so fake?\nedit: Oh I realised that this is another concept they really need to make it obvious if its a concept or not That part with the shaving cream can doesn\'t make sense. In the Jurassic Park game for the 360 that takes place around the time of the original movie deals with that. Poor dog  not me half way through the vid still wondering if it\'s fake or not ....lmao May i ask is this real and if it is BRING ME TO THE CINEMAS!!!!!! $100 says they kill off the original T Rex from the 1st movie your work was wonderful, but when you put the official trailer i played a muggle believing i would really have a new serious movie took away my joy to see it was made by a fan next time please don\'t put it the official trailer title! Now bring in the jaegers from Pacific Rim This is good!! but not official trailer Was that tom cruise in mission impossible? Perfect awesome I hope Katie Mcgrath live again in this new Jurrasic movie in 2022 buahhahaha Dude that such a cool Fan Trailer,only the Titel is a bit clickbaity. Title: “Official trailer”. Description: “Fan made trailer” Why not clone Ripper we want dat boi to feel the pain of a cloned heir Reported for click bait, nice work putting the official in the title. Let\'s hope Universal doesn\'t get greedy. :) If this was real what movie is he pulling the sam neils scenes from? Here we go with the shaving cream again lol Where\'s Tim and Rex Murphy, Sarah Harding, Nick Van Owen, Kelly Malcolm, Kirby Family and Billy Brennan in this film? Please don\'t post a fanmade trailer and claim it\'s real Esto podría ser más falso que mi vida. Para el otro año saldrá Raptor: Alan! Alan! hahaha Please oh please Mommnent of silence for some of the dinosaur that die 65my ago Putting ""Official Trailer"" in a fan made trailer is an absolutely shitty thing to do.  Just say it\'s fan made instead of trying to bait and switch people. its a good video but im gonna dislike it because im expecting it to be legit, atleast says its fan made in the title that is annoying  Officially not official, or better known as... ""click bait."" I though this was real, then I read the comments:( Good work my friend The reason why this isnt real cause its been confirmed there will be no hybrid dinosaurs tgis fake trailer showed the indorapter from fallen kingdom Such a shame that A) this is fake and B) the music drowns out plenty of the dialogue and C) half the dialogue is from previous films anyway Thanks for a fanmade bruh Primero iban a sacarla el 10 de junio del 2021 y luego por la pandemia decidieron atrasar pal 2022 de junio 10 Good fan made trailer, now remove the official part to prove you at least got some dignity. Remastered Giganotosaurus!!! there is a 3\'rd one. There i also the origional jurassic park characters instead of john hammond rip. The best jw movie ever. They even used Battle at big rock this is concept fan made but what bring fanmade trailers ? you will see scenes from the new movie...

Lucky you don\'t start getting a bunch of people reporting your channel people get pissed when you don\'t state FAN MADE Why did you put oficial trailer if it\'s a fan made?

I am so sick of these ""OFFICIAL"" trailers! bruh put fan teaser or fan made and quit hearting/ignoring comments calling you out. it\'s a ballsy move that makes you look weak and ignorant But the movie theater thing is from dominion official trailer? nah, you have my dislike just for that sorry but what tf did i see at 1:40, what did that bebe do to deserve that My guy needs to learn what official means Obviously those kids won’t get eaten. Gun, gun and bigger gun Why didn’t you put concert trailer in the title my little brother thought it was the real trailer >:( Din\'t we like see the scene on the airplane and the Cage that was jurassic world Comment savent-ils que le soit disant virus aura disparu le 10 juin 2022 ? 1:30 Peter Parker\'s Dad (Richard Parker) Daaaaaaaaamn your work fast good job Why does this look like a fan made trailer one dislike from me just for putting official in the title. Mathias Headliner heard about Jennis Thundorns by her fun across the planet as she learned every dance with Jamie Michelle Luther except hula as well as enjoy pizza and roam around the United States.

Cute teaser Is this real Bruh stop it this is called pissing the developers and fans off WOW Well... its not official. I can\'t wait to see how Hollywood f@$#s this up with political garbage. ""Dinos prefer the taste of poc,"" or new Dino brought to you by BLM.... I hold no hope for an actually good movie. I believe Jurassic world dominion takes place on Isla sorna Dr grant is back This isn’t official you need to put fanmade in the title not official Oh Mr. Arnold ! I got a bad feeling about this. While a great job, I had to down vote due to your BS title. JUST PUT CONCEPT IN THE TITLE Although this might be fake but Jurassic world dominion is coming out though Can\'t they just die by the trash we throw in the forest IM STILL WATING Why you keep posting fake/fan movie trailers without saying it. This should be penalized. is this real or fake.. just like the others ? Bruh make the title say FAN MADE NEXT TIME!!! PUT FAN MADE IN THE TITLE. Adoro el cafe cargado Alan and ellie epic poggers Cadillacs and dinosaurs. Is this fake? Fan made trailer? Doesn\'t even come close to being real CONCEPT TRAILER Ooooo cool Reported for misleading (click bait) why would you do that? Don\'t put official in your title to waste people\'s time. This is… “Official Clickbait”!!!!! Reported for misleading title. Everyone do the same. Grand returns Malcom is old in the trailer noice work tho Whoa totally real OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH :D If you make a fake Trailer,  you should not write OfFIcal TRaIlEr  Cuanto por unas entradas XD No es trailer es un fan world hmmmm where is Lupin ?

Gotta get the 13 jogger views.  No bikes lost anything. Thought it was real for a sec FAKE!! Who’s the elder in the trailer is it Alan grant? What is Everyone’s FAVORITE DINOSAUR Or Other PREHISTORIC CREATURE? A press of a button Mentira, essas cenas são de jurassick world, e jurassick park não tem nada novo ai F A K E   OFFICIAL TRAILER Ese es alan grand???? Quantas pessoas foram enganadas por essa merda de trailer falso, ao invés de colocar no título que é fan-made coloca na descrição. Esse é um dos principais motivos de eu odiar esses tipos de vídeos no YouTube. Better than Screen Culture they made a fake trailer for Dominion with clips from Rampage With The Rock please name this fan made....jesus Whether this thriller is a fake or not, it will go downhill, but the film will surely come out in 2022, I checked on the IMDB page. Sam Neil is back Jesus Christ is king ️ UAU Love the internet Jurassic park was a very good movie. Jurassic world movies are no good. Fan work nice Cooool Fan-Trailer can you do that soundtrack. Is one fanmade dont ofc trailer Fan-trailer Bruh wtf were some of these car scenes lmao. ___FAN MADE___ Doesn’t look real Sam Neil is probably going to die I saw MY COUNTRY MALTA!! (Capital city Valleta) 1:34 and 1:35 Why are there shots from wolverine Jurassic World is Real! ""Isla Sorna And Isla Nublar"" (JURASSIC WORLD AND JURASSIC PARK: NOPE) Is that in malta? Put fan made in the title Dude WTF I thought this would be the actual trailer. Misleading crap. Where is owen "" official"" lol how fake this is1 Fan made trailers are an abomination .... The music is soooo loud Hey say this is fan made Plzz Bruh i get tired of click bait Cool scenes for sure, but not an official trailer. It seems your logic was to say “official trailer” so you’d get more views. I hope you’re not a monetized channel. I got excited when I saw what I hoped was an actual trailer, but same ol’ same ol’. This  kind of crap pisses people off, myself included. Well jw 3 is going to be lame I`m fevorit movie jurassic word 3 This is a clickbait fanmade! >:( Why the hell do you write ""official"" in the title?!\nThat\'s stupid. faltan los mamiferos actuales dando pelea o si no la pelicula seria un aburrimiento Damn click bait. The others is the real trailer and the others is not Yall he put fan made in the discription Must go faster people this trailer is fake, the original trailer will only come out next year.  right close to the movie\'s release. I\'m reporting you for misleading cause that is what you did thanks man Que desastre por dios! I\'m the biggest fan Bruhh it\'s not official! wait so this is not the real trailer but it says Official Trailer I\'ve reported this video, i encourage others to do the same. JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM Bruh this fan made Dr.Grant...???? This is soo stupid, extinction of big slow animals is what humanity has been most successful at. We were even able to do it many times with stone age technology. (it took couple centuries tho) Fan made LISTEN TO THE PERSON IS THE TV SHE SAID\nS A R A Z A W A\nHOWEVER YOU SPELL HIS NAME?\nLEGENDARY PUT REFRENCE IN JW TRAILOR? Is this real Wait that\'s Dr. Allen grant an Dr. Ellie sattler You will never make the same movie as it was first Jurassic park. This is just a junk :) Why would you put official in the title. That\'s a dumb thing to do. I was interested until I saw it was directed by Colin Trevorrow... Shame. I missed a game called Durango Fan made Are there any actual trailers or are they all stupid concepts? I don’t think this is a real fan made trailer more so a leaked clip trailer. This footage isn’t in any Jurassic movie so how can a fan have this and some of the clips weren’t even edited yet either way…it’s going on my calendar Why bro Skywalk scene LOKi • Episode 2 Promo 🔻\nhttps://youtu.be/9jTwWGK1IZs That was a great trailer for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.\n\nDicks. I love how the name ""Jurassic World"" has evolved from a theme park to a part of the world itself. \nWould also like to see other eras be involved such as the terrifying Devonian Period We got like two half second clips added in with the ending to fallen kingdom It’s literally just scenes from previous movies and a scene from a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MOVIE!!! What Jurassic park was always meant to become. I can’t wait Bro they literally have the croc from rampage in there That\'s two minutes of my life I\'ll never get back. I totally Goosebump when Roberta and Mufasa Roaring each other it\'s feel like : ""Meet the Old Queen and the New King"" of each era Can\'t wait to see some of the original jurrasic park actor back in the movie!! I love the logic of the scientists in these movies lets keep making these things more deadly and dangerous have it break out casue chaos eat a bunch of people then make an even more deadlier one and are baffled when this one also breaks loose and causes chaos and eats people thats what i love about these movies That was some teaser, looks great! I have goosebumps… cannot wait! 😆 I\'m sooo Excited for this movie!!! Is it bad that I actually thought this was real for a second????? I literally am so excited for this movie - like you have no idea how long I’ve water JUST for the TRAILER…. I’ve gotta watch this theaters… gotta I feel like this movie’s date keeps getting further away rather than closer XD Could of at least had the decency of putting (fan made) or something in the title, instead of trying to pass it off as a genuine trailer for the clicks. Oh my that is going to be so cool 😍😍😍😍😍 can you just imagine a world 🌎if dinosaurs 🦕 truly lived around us and how scary 😧 that would be . Wow 😮. I am so hooked on these movies 🎥 Jurassic park is my favourite movie one of my favourite games I’m in LOVE with Jurassic if they stop making movies my life is different Who else thought it was real for the first minute lol Imagine believing this, they literally have lizzie from rampage Loved it 😀 Me encanta ☺️ amo los dinosaurios \nBendiciones I am Waiting for Jurassic world 3 😍 Lewis Dodgson would be an Amazing villain just like he was in the book. 0:51 Looks amazing 😍😍 Well done very convincing im not even upset this is a fan made trailer 👏 I always wanted to see something like this after seeing how Jurassic Park 3 ended.\n\nI just think it would be impossible for people to continue living normal lives like they are in the trailer because they could be killed by raptors, teradactyls, mosasaurus, etc in the blink of an eye. I can\'t wait to see this I hope they have the Spinosaurus in Jurassic World Dominion Amo esto 😘 Im excited......but if they be like ""oh cliff hanger! Wait for a forth movie!"" Imma die... I cant tell is this just a nice fan trailer or is this official?  To me its looks like the powers combined to form CAPTAIN PLANET! !!! For fan made, it looks better than part 2. Que emoción!!!!! Awesome 😎 can\'t wait Finally!!! Lizzie from Rampage is going to be in Jurassic World!! I can die happy now I cant wait for the movie Love this crossover with Rampage Thank god they made this movie. I’ve been waiting 4ever. This was literally a mix of Rampage and Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom. Yeah baby! That what I’ve been waiting for! El mejor trailer de la historia Mood killer when they put other movies together 😂 I actually thought this was a real trailer. Then I watched it. Super excited for this from since 2018 Oye pues si me la creí he, la primera vez que han jugado con mis sentimientos :\') Paleontoloji ve bilim kurgu hayranlarının özellikle merakla beklediği bir film geliyor. Şahsen ben aslan ve trex sahnesinde epey bir yükseldim. Film için beklentim gayet olumlu nitelikte umarım bir an önce çıkar da izleriz.. This is awesome i cant wait! Muito legal Can\'t wait to get out! I really want to see! And in which month of 2022 will the release be?\nЖду не дождусь выхода! Очень хочу посмотреть! Недавно с семьёй пересмотрела первые 2 части и теперь ещё больше хочу 3! А в каком именно месяце 2022 года будет выход? Come on man, just wait for the real thing to come out This isn\'t real, this is footage made up of other films and YouTube videos. That was awesome 🤩😃😀😁 Imagine if Dennis Nedry didn’t die - but rather was just injured in the Jeep or maybe injured and blind now but survived.… maybe he leans on the horn and scares it and it leaves or another dinosaur showed up and scared it off before he could kill Dennis.  What about the original Barbasol shaving cream container?  I’m no Screen Writer or Director but man I wish they would think of something like that!  I would love to see him back. 5 movies: We can\'t live with dinosaurs.\nJWD: We need to learn to live with them. me gustaria vivir en ese universo aunque sea peligroso IM SO EXCITED YALL🙉🙉🙉 AHHHH IM READY TO SEE OWEN AND BLUE 😭 Okay I understand the different clips from previous jurassic movies but the lizzy  clip from rampage killed it right there for me 🤣🤣🤣 When I see scenes from other movies it makes me laugh so hard that I end up falling off my chair I literally cannot wait for this movie lol Anyone else notice the scene from the movie RAMPAGE, where Lizzy swims into the city and breaks the surface of the water? I love this movie and it is hard to wait so long (blue and Maisie love them) I happened to notice that this video is not just about the new movie next year, I managed to see a few sceens of rampage and indominus rex from Jurassic World. I would love to see them all tie into one another, assuming they are going to be creating a new creature. This leaves me to believe that they will be making a larger animal half dinosaur hybrid in the next movie. Or, the dinosaurs will be exposed to gass created by a scientist accidentally spreading to the dinosaurs and increasing their bino DNA or something like that. But it might just be something random other the my conclusion to the two being intertwined with one another\'s movie. I CAN\'T WAIT I saw the actual trailer in the theatre when I watched F9, it’s pretty good I’d say but this video isn’t it for sure 😂 damn can\'t wait The first minute of this trailer look legit tbh. That would be cool if it was a real moive Ils ont réussi à transformer la meilleure saga de tous les temps en un film d’action boum boum à l’américaine complètement vide et sans saveur I hope it comes Outlook soon becus i have been waiting for ever Either a quarter of this was from the movie rampage, the first Jurassic world,  or the second one. I like how they added a clip from rampage lol 😆 0:56 The king ain\'t backing down. Epic I am eagerly waiting for this blockbuster movie I love how they managed to put no new footage in I want Jurassic Galaxy. Dinosaurs jumping into rockets and colonizing the moon and mars. Anything else doesn´t make sense. And they should start talking. It worked as well in Plantations of the apes. moment of silence for the people who thought this was real. I NEVER WOULD\'VE IMAGINED THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER JURASSIC WORLD!!!? ❤❤😮😱😱😱😱. And who would\'ve thought that Alan Grant Would be in the same film 🎥 as Bryce Howard(Clair), and Chris Pratt(Owen)!!!! Can\'t wait One part literally had a scene of lizzy from rampage bursting through the ground._. That Lion vs T-rex scene was sick. \n\nThey call me king\nPuny king melhor filme do mundo trailer starts at 1:28 Just hope this doesn\'t become like the lost world with the dinos wreaking hacok in the city... They should bring up a nee story for this one I have been waiting for this for 4 years I swear if I don\'t see a spinosaurs I\'m gonna be pissed I was laughing throughout the trailer  😂😂😂😂😂 Fun Fact:\n0:08-0:20 is actually scene of Battle at big Rock short movie which have same storyline and timeline with Jurassic World. Universal studios tell Franches ( the guy who made Jurassic World if I\'m right) to make a short movie for clue secretly. I hope they make more Jurassic Parks than Fast and Furious movies. This trailer killed me wow what wonderful trailer I have ever seen with this outstanding music I’m so exited Mr Goldblum - Was thinking about him; and next thing is, he\'s back :) That slow eerie piano just touches all the right spots Thanks for getting my hopes up They literally keeping us in the dark about the next movie actually i would like you to try what it would look like mix ""LAST OF US"" as the cities full of plants years went by together with JURASSIC WORLD!! and human remains live in towns with high walls\n\nit would be a big impact !! :D Not gonna lie, they had us in the first half Why haven’t they released even a single official trailer yet? If I remember correctly I think they said if you watch fast and furious nine in IMAX they will  play a five minute trailer for JW. I think it was five minutes Not real crocodile from rampage is in this 😂😂 Nicely put together If we read the description, they said it was ""concept trailer"", which is just another word for ""fan-made trailer."" So we as the audience share the blame for not reading properly. However, they also made a huge mistake for not putting the disclaimer on the title right away. Not every one cares about description, and something like this should probably have a better, clearer title. The bottom line is, just put ""fan-made"" on the title, not on the description. It could save you a lot of likes in the future. See what you did right there with the likes/dislikes proportion? It says all. for a fan trailer it looks good The lion will always be majestic I wonder if Chris Pratt and Bryce Dalles Howard will be in the third one? Wow....What a Fan-Made Trailer....\n\nSee How Rampage Sea Creature Comes in Jurassic World:-Dominion Trailer🤣🤣🤣 I didn\'t know Godzilla was going to be in this film, awesome As Ripper was assumed to likely attack female indoraptors and therefore they didn\'t clone girls I already miss to watch a lot of movie from 2020 and 2021, Since COVID-19. Hope can enjoy this movie in the big screen. I actually thought this was an actual trailer till the skyscraper sized crocodile. That thing is from Rampage if I remember correctly. I love Jurassic world 3 They literally have things like the big croc from Rampage 1:14, jurassic world and jurassic world fallen kingdom Wow. Nothing like chopping up a bunch of different movies to make a sneak preview. Little bit of Rampage,  Fallen kingdom, and a couple of other movies there. Wow i didn’t know rampage footage would be in jurassic world 3 Cuando sale? Can we get a new up to date walking with dinosaurs documentary? But with all this new cutting edge graphic please? A part of the trailer is from Rampage the one with the monkey and then the Giant and then the giant crocodile looking thing turn on the wolf there\'s Ralph which is a wolf in and Lizzie which was the Crocodile Noted: “Never trust Screen Culture” Can’t wait for trex to lose to giga now just because of how this always happens 1:13 oh that’s just a scene from Rampage haha 😂 Marginally better accuracy is not the same as accuracy. They are still presented as far from accurate. Estoy seguro que el T-rex se va a tragar al León, pero me encanta que el León no le baja la cabeza, como diciendo\n “la corona ahora es mía y si la quieres primero tendrás que matarm…”\n*se lo traga* Where did all of these new dinosaurs come from?! I don’t remember seeing any of them at the end of the last movie. He esperado esto durante 6 años when people are saying they where expecting a legit trailer but obviously didnt  read the description that clearly states concept During the F9 showing of the film there will be a first look for this movie I’m here for the way Jeff Goldblum says “Too many lines have been crah’s’ed” I feel bad for the people who thought this was official. Que ano que vai lançar jurassic World domínio So apparently we’ll be seeing the mutated Croc from Rampage. What’s next? Godzilla? At first I was like oh it\'s a real trailer and then I saw the scenes from fallen Kingdom and jurassic world  and- well lizzie seriously 1:14 lmao the scene from Rampage- Fan made trailers are good as you tell it is We all love legendary and they\'re Godzilla movies You had us in the first half, not gonna lie PLEASE SAVE BLUE!!!!! MR. GRADY WE NEED YOU TO PROTECT BLUE!!!!💙💙 had me in the first half not gonna lie Can\'t fn wait As you watch this movie and see dinosaurs masticate people, just remember that it\'s okay; a little girl released them so she can feel good about herself. This isn\'t even your trailer. Can we just clap for he just put in rampage scenes and the first jurassic world scenes Congrats for making a real looking trailer it’s face tho The first movie we have indominus trex. Then we got indominis lite on the 2nd movie. I wonder if we will get indominus pro on the 3rd movie I realize this was fan-made whenever I saw the crocodile from rampage and all the other stuff from other movies The theme song is the best😍😍😍. Just of the song, i am into dinosaurs. I hope screen culture stubs their toe in the pitch black and trips and falls in a pit of their own self pity. My brother loves this!! Greatest con of all time: Jurassic franchise portrayal of velociraptors. They were three fucking feet tall. However, that Cretaceous scene did not work out for the best. Giganotosaurus and Tyrannosaurusrex did not live at the same time and place. It makes literally no sense how there are this many dinosaurs now... i know why there so many dislikes  all these clips are from jurassic world 1, 2 and other movies like rampage. i want to see jurassic world 3 man I thought it was real until,INDOMINUS REX FIGHTS PHTERADONS NAH I thought this was real until Lizzie from Rapmage showed up 1:15, I was like ""WTF Rampage and Jurassic World are the same universe???"" Waisted a good chance to call the new trilogy the Mesozoic world. Guau🦖🦕 you got me so hype until you started showing clips from rampage cmon bro So... how are the main characters from the previous movie not the villains of this movie? Coitadas das pessoas que acreditaram nisso Fasten your seat belts,its going to be a hell of a ride! AGAIN😉 Advice: Don\'t trust Screen Culture If they wouldn’t have put Lizzy from rampage in this it would’ve fooled me lol And Indy will have a buddy who knows how having ""child"" is and how you can\'t consider it yours as it can be sibling or anything else as all it has is your DNA I’ll be honest, I believed this was real until there was really poor editing at the end, with the same clip from Fallen Kingdom. Yep thought that was the real thing but got fooled once again with the rampage part your telling me you can\'t just shoot those things down with all the guns you have? I mean seriously, you severely outnumber the dinosaurs and you also have the technological advantage on them. Just shoot them they can\'t take that many bullets! Here the trailer of Rampage too ahahahah Que buen fan Made Remember when we all loved the theme and now it just makes us sad about it ending and the park is now ded The comments section saved me 2 minutes of my life. Thanks guys. Can you do a tutorial of how to make fale trailers? I want to see it Jurassic World: Dominion (2022) f\'u""l\'l M\'o\'V\'i""E\n𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 ➽ https://bit.ly/2VABfRq I can\'t wait to see blue again...lol shout out to the subaru impreza wrx  avoiding dinos .  :010 \n\nalways saving you when it matters, because thats what makes a subaru........ a subaru. Wow I didn’t know the croc from rampage was gonna be in this “movie” Soooo we’re gonna look at the prehistoric trex get obliterated by a car car? Cool! Idc unless if it’s the rexy we love. Ok since when has rampage been relevant to the Jurassic park universe? There is absolutely no way that rampage has anything to do with this, and they just take footage from the attack on Chicago and put it in this movie trailer, they might have thought that they could get away with it and have people think that it’s the mesosaurus, but like, that’s clearly from rampage - Jurassic World: Dominion (2022) f\'u""l\'l M\'o\'V\'i""E\n𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 ➽ https://bit.ly/3r5oqKQ Who knew ""They do move in herds"" will be a topic of panic now. Is Fan-Made Honestly, the sheer widespread selfishness and stupidity that seems to be going around YouTube right now in regards to \'Dominion\' leaks astounds me, with so many people posting fanmade teasers and fraudulently passing them off as real. I hope the people doing this realise that YT right now so swamped with fanmade \'Dominion\' trailers that it\'s very difficult to find any legitimate leaks, and if this keeps up the studios will notice and it\'ll give fanon and fanmade YouTube content a bad name. Still got good ol Jeff in these joints 2022 is going to be a good year for superhero movies and dinosaur movies Featherless dinosaurs again... That\'s so silly, disappointing and beyond antiscientific, as it\'s widely known from decades that most theropods (and not only theropods) where as feathered as today\'s birds (which are technically dinosaurs as well, BTW) wow it will be great Cap!!!!!!! Yo, If anyone like a good simple fantasy story but with dinosuars, search up \'Tales in Scales the empty Throne\' from amazon or barnes and noble online only. a nice read while waiting for the JW Dominion Jesus te ama ❤ ❤ Nice concept trailer but still though!, I knew it immediatley because at the end, I saw that you used some scenes from the Rampage because of Croc again. One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈 Had me in the first half ngl Anything from this channel is a waste of time The Jurassic franchise has just changed so radically and we’re all running to catch up. I don’t want to jump to any conclusions, but look- this movie seems a lot like the Godzilla movie from 1998, and that’s not a great thing. Seems to me the tone of this trailer conveys that there will be more dinosaurs, more action, more death. That’s not always a bad thing- but I think that it would be easy to go overboard with it to the point where the story and character development suffer as a result. The first movie was so great because the action and carnage were kept in check. It allowed for the audience to really connect with the characters and the predicament that they were in. And as a result, when the dinosaurs did attack and eat people, it was more impactful and the audience felt the loss of each character when they got eaten.  I know its not an official trailer, but how can you possibly take Dominon seriously? How can possibly a couple of dinosaurs treathen humanity? Wouldnt the US army for example be able to take them down within 24 hours if they wanted to? These movies just feel more and more ludacris as they go. At least Jurassic World had somewhat decent story. Wow they even included a scene from rampage When homeboy said ""too many red lines have been crossed"" he sound like that dopey, racist embarrassment we got in the White House, Biden. Wow.. will spinosaurus be shown?

Ahhh yes let\'s add the crocodile from rampage with the rock and add scenes from the first jurassic world First God let you have Spinosaurus in this new Jurassic World dominion that has more prominence I don\'t even know if this is happening, buuut I wonder what\'s going to be the story. Like, it can\'t evil doer trying to sell the dinos, cus\' they\'re already free for everyone so... Just give us a real trailer ..... Imagine if it was real plus’s gorge movie was in the mix up lol is dominion really coming out? It’s got a mix of fallen kingdom and Jurassic world with a movie I can’t remember it’s name I love Jurassic world I love dinosaurs There should be a dinosaur hybrid 🔥🔥🔥 When they had scenes from the first Jurassic World :O ..i can tell it\'s fan made...if it really did happen. then i guess by any chance if sam neil returned i be damned happy. I mean you gotta be kidding me you convinced me for like 10 seconds i want mamenchia and cerato in dominon Hey when does this movie come out anyway? How I wish they will feature the kids who survived camp createcious It was small like her so called ""dad"" Ripper and could be mixed with dinosaur they have yet to Add to Indominus Cool concept #JurassicWorldDominion #UniversalPictures #LegendaryPictures pero es muy buena edicion tedeje mi like solo por eso You lit put Legendary and Universal on the thumbnail so people would believe this. if this is the real trailer then wheres the giganotosaurus nooo amigo quedo re cheto tu trailer pero se nota lo editado If we can get a first look at this, why can\'t we get a spiderman no way home trailer Next sequel - Jurassic Park: Dinosaurs in Space! The beginning was only the part that’s real Wish they wouldn’t release a trailer for a movie that comes out a year later😒 No pues me la creí 😂 Honestly it\'s not hard to put \'fan made\' in the title. You used clips from different movies, like Rampage. Hell they had me convinced lol I was believing it until rampage and A-10 scene So, basically, they merged the trailer from JW Fallen Kingdom and Rampage lol What a tease man I thought this was real 😩😩 Ok i hope that the military is in this movie They legit made the trailer mostly cut scenes/the end of the 2nd movie 😂😂😂 Guys,this is created for fun! I knew this would happen A Jurassic park movie in an even hear? Say it ain’t so Here for Jeff Goldblum ❤️ 0:18 knew a pterosaur was gonna swoop in. Who else remember Irfan khan in Jurassic park ♥️ Are there actually any real trailers? I was going through the jurassic world cast and saw jurassic world dominion and was like\n“Bullsh*t” AAA i Love it 0:01 I see there going on a realistic dinosour Wow the alligator 🐊 from rampage was a dinosaur and is one in this movie. I can’t believe that they have it. SMH when will it release? Wow I never knew you that Lizzie from rampage is going to be in Jurassic Park three OMG it will be a great movei #WarnerBrosForever #ForAutunmSnyder #ZackSnyderJusticeLeague #DCcomic Concept 👍 So will the white giant gorilla be there too? When the bug in the beginning is actually parts of Jurassic World 3 Lol, I saw the other mutant crocodile from that other movie. Then I laughed😂😂 I WANT OFFICIAL trailer now gess COME ON! Would you quit fooling people into thinking this is an actual first look and call it what it is? FAN MADE. I don\'t want a first look,  just show us the damn trailer Should have just left the series as is. Same with the Purge series, the first and second were cool but after that they don’t get better. May I ask what movie is 0:50 from? Tyrannosaurus king of the dinosaurs and jurassic island coming soon Is this real cause at first I thought this was real untill I saw the scenes from rampage. Should’ve added Optimus prime at the end I\'m crying right now there\'s scenes from different movies such as rampage and Jurassic world: fallen Kingdom Wow amazing 1:15 looks like the giant croc from rampage Bruh I was so excited 😕 They had the croc from rampage in there. And clips of the Indominus Rex. Nice job taking clips from the other movies to make this trailer. It\'s not Dominion... Just.. the end of Fallen Kingdom yes i hear it idk how long it take but jurassic world 3 comes really 1:01 what is that music is that I liked it, could you tell me the name please 🥺🥺 ane minat part 2 gan Something seemed off about this. Was this even real? I almost believe that this clip is True until I saw the Crocs from Rampage. If anyone knows the music used in this please let me know! This is just a mash up of footage from the first two as well as Rampage. Don\'t try to pass it off as the third one. They should\'ve just made the first two movies and left it at that Dammit I literally thought it was real That PARASAUROLOPHUS scene, is it from any other movie? So we got the croc from rampage and the indominus Rex? And lot of scenes from the other movies Son escenas de las dos últimas películas de Jurassic world : ^ : ( 1:13 yeah ok buddy I believe you that’s totally not a scene from rampage noooo why would it? And the scene after that is totally not Lizzie no hundred percent a dinosaur It would\'ve been fine if you said fan made but nah you had to say it was real i want loki tamil dubbed......!!!!!!!!!!!! Is it so hard to just put ""Fan-Made"" in the title? Is this an Official Trailer? At first I thought this was from before f9 then I saw rampage scenes I was like ok We just released our first children\'s audiobook! Listen to it now completely FREE! Yeah knew this wasn\'t real when I saw some of that Battle at Big Rock footage in there. Ok that\'s cool and all but what the heck happened to the other island? Is camp cretaceous season 4 going to be on that island or are we getting a new movie about said island There was only like 3 new things otherwise it was just showing clips from the other movies 1:02 the per in the middle is one of the main reasons why I’m watching it Believable until it showed the croc from rampage There was a Rampage scene in there😂 casi me la creo Nice job of taking old movies and putting it in the thinking we won\'t notice T-Rex sure seems to get its ass kicked by everyone without help. Seems like the weakest big carnivore I noticed how they took parts in some movies and put in there. but there is an official trailer its the other dominion trailed cuz the mosasaurus never escaped from the island in no past jurassic world or jurassic park movie so some parts of that were from the official trailer The scenes were mainly taken from the last movie... kinda weird tbh Thought this was legit until I saw scenes from Jurassic World 1 and then some scenes from Rampage. Legendary pictures god so much money because of Godzilla versus Kong and now they’re making a new movie :) Looks crap? Like so few dinosaurs actually escaped into the wild at the end of the last movie that there is zero chance it would have any real kind of major impact. The great white breach was literally taken from Discovery channel… Just added the Mosasaurus… They had to add the Rampage crocodile.... And after they were doing a good job with the actual scenes... I mean- why name if ‘first look trailer’ if it has two different movies 😑 first if we analyze it well some scenes are from juraccic world the fallen kingdom another scene is not from the jurassic world movies it is from another movie and at the end to lengthen the video you left it all black so you can improve I got Transformers vibes Gotta love the re-upload If your a fan of these types of movies you will know so fast cuz they use a clip from rampage and the last movie Does it take after or before Godzilla vs Kong 1:15 ""Rampage: devastation"" scene... i wonder if they add quetzalcuatles This is the trailer from Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom but first few clips looked real tho Rampage in Jurassic World Genius idea Uses universal AND legendary logo, tries to pass it off as a real trailer... is... is this legal?... Oh yess finally Rampage + Jurassic World 1 & 2 but not bad at all Y’all got rampage scenes in this clip😂😂 I hate when people put a bunch of scenes of previous movies and say it is a new trailer 🤨 What the hell. I thought its the real First look... Sick I have to wait till 22 I thought was real for one minute and ten seconds until I saw rampage in it Hans Moleman: You stole 2 minutes of my life away from me and I want them back...oh, forget it! I\'d just waste them again anyway. I like movies of Jurassic World That surfer shot looks like a low budget bad cgi from 1990s Dang Why didn\'t they clone a clone by using Ripper for DNA be fun to another dinosaur have a ""child"" that was really from DNA samples yall would not believe the smile i had on my face for most of the video, then lizzie pops up...\n\nMe: Disappointed\nMy Smile: Obliterated No way it is real though Thought we wouldn\'t notice the croc but we did ...or “Jurassic Park meets Transformers” The fact that people are upset with the fact that this isn’t a real trailer of a movie where Universal continues to rape a franchise is astonishing jurassic world 3 dominion 2022 first look trailer\n60% clips from previous JW movies\n10% clips from other movies\n10% terrible dramatic music See, I thought it was real, then indominus. bruh, that ""trailer"" would be sick if it was real. It was only a matter of time before this happened What a coincidence, it aaallll happens to be previously seen footage Literally had clips form completely different movies Wow!! Bruh they had a scene from rampage, a totally different movie -_- Stop fooling me\nThis isn\'t even gonna be real \nMost of these scenes are from fallen Kingdom and jurassic world It\'s impossible how they live with humans I\'m going to pretend l didn\'t see the alligator rampage in this fan trailer But is 0:27 a real scene? That girl was in Jurassic world 2 right? That shot didn\'t come up before Sure some of that was from Rampage 😂 YESSSSS Mans rlly had to have the croc from Rampage in there When people use clips from previous movies. Caught in 4K ultra hd 🤣 Its a part 2 trailer and its a crocodile from rampage not mosasaurus I was super stoked, but then I read the comments Dude that was the fallen kingdom trailer 😂💀🗿 Are you serious. The indominus, the croc THEY FROM OTHER FILMS imagine a movie trailer that gonna be release in 2022 but we cant a trailer for fucking trailer for  Spider Man no way home They are just cutting the scenes from first 2 movies At least put concept in the title aswell, not only the description smh Rampage gives it off.... Rampage and jurassic park exist in the same universe confirmed. Lmao 0:15 great white shark:NOT AGAIN\nMosy:ooo yum Yeah. .... Killing time! Hunting time!!! if Jurassic world fallen kingdom and rampage made a movie: I thought this was dinosaurs live action remake もう人間と恐竜が共存してる世界なんだ The Sound Is Very Similar To Black Widow Trailer. bro the indominous rex was in that damn ive been clic baited And hold on did I see indominus rex? So no new movie content? Bro this got me laughing lol Casi me la creo Lets see if i still have plot armor Lol They should just tittle this Movie the ultimate ""JURASSIC WORLD"" Thats cool, but what about Harry Potter and the Cursed Child? Looks like someone lost the bloody plot. Great Job!! Nice edits Dude 1:11 good job editing. Nice Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom x Jurassic World 2015 and Rampage trailer Anyone else think that this is leading up to turok the dinosaur hunter Some scenes are from battle at the big rock What movie is 0:56 from? Oh sure NOW they give in to the fact that most theropod dinosaurs had feathers. Its about time lol It seems Not a complete trailer and mixed scenes of fallen kingdom and rampage  in the end😯... I pitched this script to my wife like 10 years ago The one scene is from the movie rampage F for people who belived in this trailer I didn\'t know Naomi Harris was in this movie but there she is 1:11 you know this trailer is not official, right They need Jurassic park to be rated r horror real killing if that’s the case who scarier  Dino or chucky Europe should be safe we just gotta close every single beach there They put in Lizzie from \'Rampage\' in the trailer. I am looking forward to the movie big time but this ,whatever 😣was bull s The lion was like .. I’m still king ion care Alguna escena habran reales, pero hay otras que son de otras películas!!! No os dejéis engañar!! Alguna de esas escenas es de rampage They used some footage from other Jurassic World movies or Jurassic Park movies and then a used rampage because we literally saw the crocodile Lizzie 1:14 isn’t that rampage? Trex is the coolest dinosaurs in the world right guys This is going to be so bad, can\'t wait They actually had the nerve to put the croc from rampage. BBBBRRRRUUUUHHHH Welcome to Jurassic World Fanmade Trailer I feel like I have seen almost all of this before…. Lame…. Could\'ve been way better Lion be tripping ball’s roaring at a t-rex with no fear So where\'s the first look \nThis is just clips from other movies I know the actor for one of the kids he looks like he’s blond and 7 he’s actually 9years old 1:15 spinosaurus with Godzilla size Why the hell did I see a scene from Rampage? Ok some of that footage was from the movie rampage. Come on now Bruh they added a rampage monster into the trailerಠ_ʖಠ Sees rampage croc in there\n\nMe: imma head out I just realized this is screen culture HALF OF THOSE CLIPS ARENT EVEN THE SAME FRANCHISE some kind of 3rd worlds gonna find these ""historical documents"" and think we made contact with dinosaurs lmao xD So what film is this for Jurassic world, jurassic world fallen kingdom or rampage im confused It will be good if it was just rickroll but i guess it was only the so what they called ""Fan made"" Brother Indominus Rex🤔😱 Rampage + Jurassic world + Jurassic world: fallen kingdom + details of san andreas... Bro hard to believe because I saw some scenes from the movie Rampage Has all these scenes from other movies (like the indominous Rex A franquia acabou no segundo filme... Lol there were like 7 dinosaurs, all different species, that got unleashed upon the world in the last movie. How is this movie possible? lol They literally recreated the music in marvel endgame\'s teaser 1 You just HAD to include Rampage scenes in this FAN-MADE trailer.....-.- okay im sick of thinking about this they\'re acting like dinosaurs have taken over the planet but in the last movie all of them were contained in one basement how did a couple of dinos turn into a new era of life Btw guys this is a mix of different movies 1:16 this is Lizzie from rampage this video is not real sorry to burst the bubble :( Ok so you have Jurassic world, rampage, Jurassic world 2, and like so many more clips from other movies. Well that isnt the actual trailer one theres the croc from rampage the only thing that is in the traileris the car and the case but the rest heel knaw Bro at least put the word “concept” in the title💀 The trailer is already out man Welcome to Jurassic World People belive this? 😂😂 This is clips from all the other movies or short movies They are making a 3rd one though... saw Jurassic World toy advertisements... and 2 of the guys the was in the original 1993 Jurassic Park movie confirmed a 3rd one 0:14 There\'s always a bigger fish. No offence but this whole video was basically the final scenes of jurassic world fallen kingdom I thought it was real until I saw the footage from Rampage movie 😂 man originality is gone with the human race.  A mashup from different films is not a new trailer. The owners of the rights outta sue these guys. Holy hell right keen as You forgot to add Aladar too 😒 And to think this all started with a pre historic mosquito 0:43 hold on a damn second on stop of stygimoloch its.. DREADNOUGHTUS?? anyone else thought this was real until the comments Wtf, legit have 4 scenes from RAMPAGE in there. I\'m interested but all I keep thinking is....but they have GUNS. I can\'t wait to count how many people die thanks to the one stupid clone girl. I will watch this just for the body count. Nice fan made trailer you‘ve created this is a teaser trailer. i seen the real trailer 0:57    😱 the crocodile of rampage 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Scenes during the end credits of battle at big rock Lol these are clips from Jurassic world 2😄 this is fan made because all scenes are scenes from other movieslike fallen kingdom dr. ian malcolms speech and like that for anybody that thinks this is real, it\'s not. they dont put concept in the title to get more views. stupid if you ask me. Mucho ejército y soldados. Me parece que va a ser malisima idk why but it\'s just really annoying how they add clips from rampage lol I just watched the end a fallen kingdom and 2 seconds from rampage So is Rampage or Jurassic World? nice I was watching and the suddenly the crocodile from rampage showed up Avengers assemble! Give back my 2.02 minutes More than half of it is from rampage Where’s the clip from 0:53 from? Yeeeaahhh, y\'all got me. 😏 Never again.

Douchenozzle. Bro they but Lizzie the croc from rampage in here might as well call it Jurassic World:Rampage It\'s like they didn\'t even bother to try and make an effort to trick us into thinking this is a new trailer. Straight garbage. Looks like kino check was fooled this time too Bruv, u used practically everything from JWFK so \U0001f978 haven\'t seen the 2nd one yet😭😭😭😭 The music is dope though wait.....another one?!?!?! seriously??? 1:15 is the crocodile from rampage Bruh this is not the trailer they just took some scenes from other movie 1:16 is the crocodile from Rampage bro… Nah, huevos, yo si me ilusione We just want play Dino What a waste of time .There was even scenes from rampage in it. 1:09 That part was from TMNT 2014  and the next clip was from Rampage No way could animals that large exist as long as theres 6billion people on the planet. Something would have to go extinct or this could lock up all oxygen One scene was from rampage Is that Scorpius rex🥵🥵🥵 so is this just a Jurassic world primordia 3 the lost world re-evolved rip off? thought this was good until it literally showed the mutated crocodile from rampage :( No mames esto son solo las ecenas finales de el ""reino caido"" Bruh half of this was fallen kingdom or rampage Omg blue she is my favourite Did I just saw the lizzy the giant alligator in rampage😂😂😂😂😂 why do million sub channel give such a video which is fan made🤣 Say fa made in the title.

Can\'t take this anymore! It completely fizzles my will to watch these films. Hope I\'m wrong but with this movie I\'m not expecting nothing out of the same ordinary and formulaic movie-making formula that it\'s been dominating the industry for the past decade. Soy la única que quiere que blue tengo más crias Wait, you added rampage into it?!?!\n\nAlright, this movie is lazy AF Jurassic world: the game. predicted that carnoraptor was gonna be in an Jurassic world movie bc they had carnoraptor in their game and then you see carnoraptor in this trailer\nEdit: carnoraptor shows up at 0:45 Is Alan Grant back tho? Una escena de rampage? Almost got me Yes .blue become  indominus rex Parts of this trailers is from the movie rampage Never get off the island...

Rampage x Jurassic world 😂😂😂😂 Did anyone else see Lizzy from rampage in there 1:10 - 1:16 серьезно? вы использовали кадры из фильма: ""реймпейдж"" Esto es falso, mezcla escenas finales de JW 2 con escenas de Rampage Devastación y solo un edit básico. Rampage croc 😤💀 Theres a documentary about saving animals called dominion.Check it out So where\'s the Autobot and Ultraman? Its Fan made! Fan made confirmed 🤩🏳️\u200d🌈 Why is it mixed with Rampage?? One of the clips were from rampage Fanmade too! Y\'all had me >:o Wow you even got the date wrong too. Interesting 1:14, wtf is that dinosaur ? Sounds like a totally invented one.. like it does look like a Sarcosuchus and a dragon.\n\nAlready with the Indominus Rex and the Indoraptor were plain stupid.. they really have to stop creating things like that :/  Jajajaj jaja una escena de Rampage ahí La cosa più cringe è il “first look now” e il “logo” “Dominion” 😂😂 ad inizio video. Bro, facevi più bella figura mettendo “fan Made” e bona invece di sta pagliacciata. \n😂😂 Raptors with hair?? That\'s ...... New? well edited,you watched Rampage? It\'s rampage and the Indominus rex If rexy die we riot THIS IS A FAN TRAILER. ALL FOOTAGE IS REUSED The croc from rampage is In here It’s kind of sad that I believed this before reading the comments\nI’m 11 alright ;-; Wow nice edit that is Jurassic world fallen kingdom and rampage The trailer is fanmade Hol up i saw the legendary logo If the Dinosaurs survive the 6th mass extinction event I will diiiiiieeeeee hahahahahahaha some scenes were rampage The falsity of that was lost for me, squashed by the assault on my ears from hideous generic, cut and paste noise they call soundtracks these days. Fan made trailers are just an insult to an average person\'s intellect. Seriously! Fan trailers always make me cringe. Bruh this is the 2nd movie mixed with with other movies why you never put in the title it is a concept? right, cause would not get even a single view This is different clips from different movies- I thought it was real until i saw the croc from ramapage i just now realized in the zoo sence it was a king of the jungal facing the king of the dinos i like how much of a joke this is this is real? Rampage is Jurassic World crossover Either fan made, or just super lazy producers ഉഫ് തീ 😍 AHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH THIS IS SO REAL YOU SO DIDNT ADD LIZZIE FROM RAMPAGE …. Why did I see the rampage crocodile in this Why\'d u put a clip from rampage in there as in the croc All materials from this short is from second movie Bro you are just mixing movies up together Bruh the last shot was the crocodile monster from rampage They have lizzile from rampage.. they is no real trailer until unverisal will release a real trailer Why the hell rampage croc is in it? Ins\'t even an dino. Canción de fondo del principio del vídeo? Me suena de algo  :v Nice legit trailer Good editing though Why is there a part from Rampage? That\'s not the real trailer Looks like kamlooops in the background  1:16 part of the film was filmed there If you sit here and make a Jurassic World video that’s just a bunch of scenes from the ending and other parts of Fallen Kingdom and put a small half a second scene from that atrocity movie Rampage and try to say it’s a Dominion trailer and then have the slightest hint of balls to say subscribe to you YA KNOW YA DONE FUCKED IT UP!

Minions: The Rise of Gru,"['54yAKyNkK7w', '3Y9XeruN5RY', 'k7ILRVC4FGQ', 'Ph-aRamJdGo', 'G14gBKT6gu0']","['Minions: The Rise of Gru NoneNoneNoneAh yes, we definitely needed another minions movie. I love that the minions have always managed to accidentally screw over their previous bosses and now they\'ve been sticking with Gru from his childhood onwards. I just love how the minion says ,"" MINI BOSS"""" This whole franchise has some of the best prequels ️ Gru is actually pretty sweet to the minions Indonesians doesn\'t have to claim anything, it is \'Bahasa Indonesia\' the language Bob was using because the voice behind Bob is Pierre Coffin, who is half Indonesian as his mother was a famous Indonesian novelist. Pierre is also one of the creators of minions (he\'s an animator as well), and the one who has been voicing the minions all these years, not just Bob. He is also the director of Despicable Me 1-3 & Minions (2015). Gru is the best villain character i have seen in my entire life . The way Bob says ""mini boss "" was so cute i;m so happy that trailers are coming out now, makes life a bit more interesting and gives us something to wait for :) Gru\'s the only one who understands minion. None of the other boses understood what they were saying. I love Gru\'s voice\nIt\'s like making pancakes with nutella i laughed when the tall minion was tired of hammering he just smack the short one with a hammer XD The way Bob and Kevin say good night  melts my heart Sooo, apparently, ""Nasi goreng, kecap manis?"" equals to ""I\'m scared, may I sleep with you?""\nOkay, minions! :D I\'m looking forward to seeing a Despicable Me 4 someday and who knows maybe there will also be a villainous team in it. Minion : nasi goreng kecap Manis \nGru : ok come here let\'s sleep together \n\nMe : what I used to LOVE the minions when I was a girl. Sadly, with each movie that comes out in this series the original fans are far too old for it\'s maturity rate. I feel like they should have went with the strategy that Ninjago had: starting childish and maturing as the little fans grow older so they can grow up together. Can\'t wait to see Minions 2! Bob is so darn cute!  Bob just stole my heart freaking cuteness overload hshshshhs The minion\'s voice charger was mister Pierre coffin, which was one of France\'s voice actresses and he was born in 1967. Her mother was called nursri handini, a novelist of the Indonesian national and her father was yves coffin native to France. So naturally there\'s an Indonesian word on one of the lines because the old man from the voice came from Indonesia.. salute for indonesia🇮🇩 (source:wikipedia) Minions are only wholesome when they aren\'t used for memes AWWWWWW I LOVE HOW THEY GREW UP TOGETHER!!! Looks like Gru’s not going to get a good night  with minions around. Loved the way the minion said good night at 0;30 it\'s just sooo cute Just love it when they called him mini boss Still wondering though what ever happened to those minions that:\n\nFell down the cliff (minion)\nFlown to space (Despicable me) ""nasi goreng,kecap manis??""\nI\'m like...whaattt!!?\nI\'m an indonesian okee....indo and malay have a same language but how we spell it was different,so next time if u\'re coment ""yoo this is malaysian"" that you are wrong check the fact first bro  I\'m an Indonesian I hear ""nasi goreng kecap manis, terima kasih"" I was immediately amazed that minions can speak Indonesian, it\'s so cute I wonder how Gru would’ve turned out if his mother wasn’t emotionally abusive to him..like what if he ended up with his dad I understand how Gru communicates with every Minion...\nHe can understand every single language. Is no one gonna talk about how cute Bob looks in those feetie pajamas? love the way Kevin always be there and take care of Dave Steve carrell did the fantastic job in gru\'s characters voice Omg so many great animations coming out on 2021 im actually getting hopes from this Anyone notice how awesome the 3d modeling are in this movie bro  0:24  that line cracked me up  I can’t wait to see this !\nThis looks so cute 0:38 I like the way they increased the bed from right side when he jumped on it They act like children having nightmares even though their millions of years old “Mini boss?” Awwww that’s so cute  imagine someone like gru sleeps with monions it melts my heart. Minion and bannana still a better love story than twilight Wow, minions are basically cats— they steal your bed, mess up your plans, have no regard for safety and are cute as heck Bob saying nasi goreng kicap manis is the cutest! Gru looks soo adorable  1:42 that response couldn\'t be more perfect did something happen to otto future into the series? i have never seen him in any other despicable me movies, and with a minion like that youd think theyd give him screen time. I wonder how everyone\'s gonna feel after Illumination made us wait too long after delaying it so many times First the girls want him to read a bedtime story and do some smooch farewells and now the minions demand to sleep with him because they have nightmares. 0:51 the best scene of the trailer I love how minions speak Italian instead gru speaking english XD Me and my dad will see this movie when everything is safe. did anyone else notice that a minion has two different coloured eyes at the beginning ""Mini boss?"" Classic line  gosto muito desse desenho kkkkkkkk can we all agree instead of a minions movie we actually MOVE ON in this series pls Everyone: the minion’s eyes are different\n\n\nMe: Gru is smiling at Bob Ah isn\'t bob just the cutest thing? Can\'t wait for the sequel Did anyone notice that the one with the teddy bear i think his name is bob has to different colored eyes? That was the cutest ""terima kasih"" i ever heard ️ I can\'t wait for a quiet place part 2 I really really really want to see that I really love Minions ️️️ I definitely want to see this. Now I\'m wondering when will the trailer for Sing 2 come out. I can\'t believe there are so many despicable me sequels! \n1. Minions\n2. Despicable me\n3. Despicable me 2 I can’t wait to watch this movie ️️ Back when he still had hair! 0:54 I spat out my ice cream laughing Despicable Me is the best animated movie franchise of all time. Aw gru is so nice when someone had a nightmare oh my gosh i friggin love Bob he\'s adorable and sweet esp with his teddy bear So who else was expecting ALL of the Minions to want to sleep with Gru? Minions have the cutest voice on the whole universe  So as I observed in the comments section, ""May I sleep with you?"" in minionese is ""Fried rice Soysauce?""XD I watched this trailer at night and when I hear the minion said ""nasi goreng kecap manis"" , it made me craving for nasi goreng  How could he understand their language?\n+ The way they said \'Bud night\' awww so adorable!! 0:37 momento inesperado Мощно. С нетерпением жду премьеры! My favorite character is Gru cause he is a good villan  The meaning of ""Nasi goreng"" is friend rice, and for ""kecap manis"" is sweet soy sauce. This was where Gru lived when he was little? Not really so villainous, don\'t you think? 0:39 bob, kevin, stuart... this give memories Love them or hate them this is an adorable scene\n0:14 I like how the minions speak every language Bro I can\'t wait!!\nLike despicable me is my childhood and I love minions can\'t wait for this movie, but I hope they will also make the sequel for despicable me 3... Okay now I know how famous \'nasi goreng\' and \'kecap manis\' are. I am so proud of that. I cant wait for this Reaching out the bed while saying cutely ""terimakasih..."" Can\'t wait :D I like how they call gru mini boss Me : mom can we have gru movie 4?\nMom : we have gru movie 4 at home\nGru movie 4 at home : Finally a new footage of the movie. “You traded our future, for some pet rock!?”          -Teen/child gru Minions\n\nGru: 8 years old  Believe it or not but it\'s actually the Minions that soften up Gru for the girls in the future and prevented him from being really evil.\n*Sarcastic*nice work Gru\'s mom   slow I absolutely hated D3 because it felt too forced, too many fart jokes, minions, and a pretty bad storyboard when compared to the other two. \n\nThis actually looks fairly decent as it actually looks like an organized story on Gru’s origins, it doesn’t rely heavily on the minions for literally every comedic line, and it doesn’t look like it has been rushed at all. Fair game illumination. He was already a good dad to begin with 44 and I can\'t wait for this. Have all their songs and I\'m British. Took ages to learn .  minions and despicable movies. Very clever, very funny, will be the best movie of 2021  how cute....\nI love it Come here because that “ nasi goreng kicap manis “ aww that’s soo cute  Fun fact Bob is saying that his dream was about an "" evil Fried rice"" \nI can understand stand my Gru is not buying the story “Nasi goreng, kecap manis” My favorite food in indonesia I love minions so much  Gru is  the super villain I’ve seen eagerly waiting for this movie son los miniuns originales que nostalgia Minions were a literal stroke of genius. Why do I keep squealing over the ""Mini Boss?"" out of every movie trailer i\'ve seen this one is the best The way Bob says nasi goreng kecap manis or in english will be fried rice and sweet soy sauce, and then terima kasih  is soo sweeet Ya quiero la película de Minions 2 Trop marrant j\'adore les minions    ️  Minions my favorite ️ 0:07 - Nasi Goreng : Fried Rice\n0:07 - Kicap Manis : Sweet Soy Sauce\n0:15 - Terima Kasih : Thank You What happens is that small gru was trying to riseto power so he went to see some super villans to help him but they laughed at him so he stole a womans necklace and went on a wild gose chase eventually small gru gave the locket to his minion who ended up trading it for a pet rock Kid Gru sounds like Dru so that means it\'s just the same vice actor as old Gru wow. How does this even work because we had NO SIGNS of young Gru owning minions before the first Despicable Me. What exactly can these minions have nightmares about? I hope this goes on netflix Aw that is so cute ️ minion Bob is so cute  Im super happy that Bob\'s Back  0:52 He\'s hammering a screw. A screw. What. I <3 this!

Thor: Love and Thunder,"['KHPrDP0F5_o', 'eK_LB60jmnA', 'rZHpYK1geSw', 'A_VH7EXqHXc', 'mqKAhsp-QqQ']","['Thor: Love and Thunder Brilliant! I was engaged from the start till the end. LOVE the feeling and atmosphere you have created here I loved how everyone was looking at thor like a sad hysterical being in end game but antman is digging the story just happy hes there Imma be so mad if Loki ain’t in this movie, they find multiple ways to bring him back so they can find a way to put him in this movie, I want him and present Thor to reunite Nobody:.....\nMarvel: Making everyone worthy. I loved this trailer. Awesome way of bringing back the old stories to create a new one i\'m gonna love the movie Just going with the feel of having fun all around in Taika\'s Thor, it would be so incredibly funny to hear Phil Collins - In the Air Tonight, in Thor Love and Thunder. That would also very nicely merge the love of 80\'s anthems from The Guardians of The Galaxy cinematic world. Just putting it out there. I already don’t feel like watching this movie after finding out that Loki won’t be here. I loved Thor Ragnarok because of their special bond as brothers Now THIS is how you make a concept trailer. You put CONCEPT instead of OFFICIAL.\nVery engaging trailer, actually got me hyped for the even just the actual trailer! <3 Me everytime watching a Marvel movie: ""Wait so is it before that end game? What time is it exactly?"" But Thor is not Thor without Loki🥺💚 Remember: This is a concept trailer I keep holding out hope that Amara the Enchantress will make an appearance in a Thor movie. I hope Karl Urban gets more screen time now that Thors friends were killed. Know he was supposed to have died but if Loki can survive several deaths, I hope he can too love the idea of drunken Thor telling the origin story of Jane Foster SO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE I LOVE THIS Love this! Well done!! I Hope To See Hercules In This Movie, I Know This Is A Concept Trailer But Still... It Would Be Cool Nice! Love the way this has been put together. It deserves way more views! Anyone who is foolish enough to dump Thor is not considered worthy in my book. Okay, okay, this part will be without Loki, but you can at least at the end insert the brothers\' hugs for 2 minutes and ""I promised that the sun will shine over us"" The story in the comics was so good. Glad it\'s coming to the screen! I don’t think Jane is going to be wielding Mjolnir, I think it’s very well possible that she is going to become a Valkyrie rather than her wreilding Mjolnir and possessing the powe of thor. I’m sure there’s going to be some development and she’s going to be using Mjolnir in a fight while she is a Valkyrie, It makes more sense due to the supply of Valkyries being low and the introduction of Zeus proves that Thor isn’t just going to be powerless the entire time. This movie is gonna be mind blowing amazing awesome and worthy i wish it could be release in 2021 but we have to wait stil 2022. As long as there will be Loki in it,I\'ll watch it! I think Loki will come back. Because of the TV series Loki was released. \n\nso lets keep our hopes high brothers and sisters!!!! Can y’all please just turn Thor into what he was at the end of endgame I miss that so much Finally something to look forward to Say what you want, but I’m excited to see Jane again. Natalie Portman is GODDESS 😍🤤☺️ At first I was like damn no loki then I realized he gets his own show This lools really awesome. Looking Forward to this now С нетерпением жду выхода фильма. It looks real bro good job keep it up. I\'m big of thor who is waiting for Thor 4.you earned subscribe button. This movie is going to be awesome, nice job you put together! Heartbroken that we have to wait sooooo long!! Can\'t wait to watch it Fat thor did put me down... Glad to know the muscular thor will come back de qual linha do tempo será que ela vai buscar e erguer o MJOLNIR ? There will only be one thor in my eyes cant wait to watch the real official trailer of this. The way the design of the title is made. Reminds me of 80\'s childhood cartoons, HE-MAN. It should be cool. Taika\'s good at combining modern and classic into one masterpiece. This Is gonna be EPIC!!! Eagerly waiting to watch this movie ❤ Waiting is the pits🤷🏻\u200d♂️\nI just want to watch them all now,like right now😂\nThis,black widow,Loki etc This looks fire 🔥 Finally!!Jane is back This is a great concept trailer! Well put together, cheers! \nHemsworth is actually saucing his face off in preparation for his HulkHogan role right after Love&Thunder so THIS Thor will end up being quite bigger and more jacked than usual. Perhaps explained by the god of thunder actually working to get back in shape and ""eating salad"" as his mums last conversation with him suggested he do. Jane Foster Thor in the comics had advanced cancer, the heroics were making it worse and killing her. Lots of drama, very heroic, very worthy. But it\'s a story that developed over a long time. How Thor became unworthy so she would even try it was also a big story in its own right, and we\'ve already done that arc in Movie 1, sort of. Could be tough to pull off. I have loved the Thor Movies, especially Loki but now Loki\'s gone, Odin is gone, Frigga is gone. He lost his friends, his best friend and  He lost many of his people and let\'s be honest that he now lives on Midgard with half the Asgardians is not the right thing either. He has no one anymore. I dont know if it\'s the same without them. I dont want that Jane become the ""Almighty Thor"". Who has the same opinion? Nice. but i miss Loki 😭 i want him back :( You keep going next level with your videos 🎥👍 I could swear the scene in this room with the"" start from the beggining "" was from the film  annihilation I miss loki😭😭 I\'m very excited. Taika Waititi did so well with Ragnarok, make Thor 1/2 Thor fun. So hopefully he can make Jane fun too instead of limiting Natalie Portman\'s talent The more thor ages, the more thor becomes wiser and stronger Sin loki no vale nada 😭😭😭😭 I hope Quill be in this :3 Whoever holds this Hammer, if [HE] be worthy, [HE] will posses the power of Thor\nJane Foster: - I am about end this god\'s dignity this would have been a great time i think to introduce Storm? é sempre bom sonhar kkk Thor:  Love and Thunder.   NOW WITH ONLY 35% THOR! THANOS : i am flipping a coin what are you choosing ?\n\nTHOR : I will go for TAILS\n\nTHANOS : HAHAHA ! YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR THE !HEAD!\n\nTHOR : WTF ! i’m so exited for this Isso e incrível If that trailer doesn’t hype you up idk what will.... and DAMN..... Natalie Portman still looking fine after all these years the beginning scene of this trailer is from the movie < Annihilation>, I thought Natalie Portman was awesome in that one ~ Yeah, I’m done. It was an alright ride but Endgame was the nail in the coffin for Thor and thus I’m out I really hope this won’t disappoint me. NATALIE deserve that chance ❤️❤️🔥 AHH YASS JANE IS BACK :D They might ruin thors unique characteristic with a female version of him\n\nEdit : something that makes no sense in the comics jane foster gets a transformation from picking up thors hammer and she even gets the name thor and all his powers and former thor is now just called odinson but what really has me inna bunch is when captain america picked up the hammer he didnt get no transformation he was only able to throw lightning from the hammer he didnt get the powers of thor or a transformation meanwhile jane foster did hair color and all and in one of the previous thor movies odin whispered to the hammer that whoever wields it should posess the power of thor but jane is a human with no power im confused as hell they are adding something that doesnt make sense That was from Avengers endgame and the first Thor in the second Thor movie and Adventures Infinity War 2 and you just put that all into one making the trailer like what\'s okay how about this I\'ll give you 10 out of 10 that was really good actually I honestly don’t want them to bring back Jane… Had me at the beginning. Great job! Cada vez más cerca del estreno de What if i can\'t wait for that anymore Happy to participate in some excerpts of the film. woow  l   am    looking    forward  to  it. It   seems  amazing Who else is broken after watching marvel movies without iron man, black widow and captain America? 💔💔 Not gonna lie. He had me in the first 20 seconds No way she picks up mjolnir that would be straight cap Does anyone know if Loki will be in Love and Thunder? I mean, I know he\'s dead, but this is Loki we\'re talking about... Remember the time when only ""THOR"" was worthy? I love this movie in the future year Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor. This is the enchantment, that’s on the hammer. So I’m almost certain the “ hammer “ , Jane foster’s gonna hold was forged Once more. The strongest avenger the  most powerful marvel superhero and my number 1 favorite hero of all time I can’t wait for love and thunder in 2022 If she picks up Mjolnir like cap did I will never watch any Marvel movie again Thor better be the main character still Me hubiera gustado que Loki estuviera en esta película O que a Mulher Maravilha faz nesse treiler rsrs Суть в том , что она в отличие от других, всех кто брал молот. Ещё была носителем вещества вселенной -  видимо он её перестроил,  и она стала способна владеть разным оружием, тело трансформировалось. Есть такая большая вероятность. we need the man thor Director seriously hates Thor, that’s why he is ruining his body I see people saying it needs to be more comic accurate... Y\'all ever heard of mighty Thor? Aka Jane Forster i love that retro looks and music I just want to see Loki Remember who directs this movie: a guy who loves one piece! he was spottet wearing luffys current bounty as a shirt. no wonder i love the comedy and the movie itself so much (Ragnarok) Its marvellous 😀 🙂 Thor: who are you?\nGorr the God Butcher: I am batman. THIS IS A REALLY GOOD CONCEPT TRAILER YOU DIDNT TAKE SCENES FROM ANOTHER MOVIE WHICH WAS GREAT So many guys thought this is real 😂😂 I would like them to adapt the comics to an intense degree by saying Jane Foster has cancer because of the freaking stone that was inside of her They have thousands of way to bring back Loki...But they aren\'t doing that...Without Hiddleston a Thor movie is surely incomplete...I want him back... I really want to see the movie Please make thor like before we are missing his fitness badly I\'ve heard that starlord is gonna take place of thor\nhahh I am gonna miss him Hope they don\'t trash Thor just to ""empower"" the girl. They did it in the comics and I hope they won\'t do it here. Nice and love the 1980\'s grafics Thank you natie, taika, and the best chis in Hollywood. Oh...I LOVE♡ Thor! Loki and Thor\'s pair is amazing , awesome , wonderful .......\nI don\'t have words to express \n🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 What\'s the movie with Natalie Portman fighting? I want to watch it. Did anyone else notice that some of those scenes are from Avengers: Endgame? No, just me? Looks like one of my favourite character is getting side tracked, well it\'s time to leave the Marvel for me.\n\nMaybe some people will enjoy it, and it can\'t always be the same as it used to be. But this might be the last one I will see as a marvel fan. These Producers are Straight Cheezin\' Out Hard!!!  LMFFFAO!!!  Nerd AWESOME Yo extraño al thor delgado como aparese  al final de video Hoping Thor comes out of depressed and unmotivated fat stage, it was funny for one little movie, but we want strong courageous Thor back ❤️ Thor is my favorite hero and I will stop watching Marvel if he is replaced So there is a man, born as a god, raised by war. countless war. grandson of Bor. a warrior baptized under fire. .Becomes god of thunder by his hand..... Then comes a chick, a scientist chick, stronger than Thor all of a sudden? 😂😂😂 im confused as to why they say that Thor lost his title and status when jane possesed his power because if you an og and have read the comics you would know that Thor did not lose his power and status he still had it. jane however became worthy of lifting mjolnir and just like Steve Rogers in endgame she possesed his power and Thor was still Thor. so i hope hey fix that before they get to far in the movie because that would really suck if you were almost done filming or if you were finished and they were like \'wait. we did it wrong.\' This better not be about Jane it’s called Thor for a reason All of the set photos and the casting seems really cool. But I\'m still on the fence about this film mainly because of the concept they\'re doing with Jane Foster Thor. I\'m sorry but I\'m really not a fan of the idea. Not cause I\'m sexist (though people will dish that insult out), but because in the MCU co trinity it just doesn\'t feel warranted.\nI know that the original comic line this was based on wasn\'t that well received either, but give credit that the reason why the drama with Jane and her cancer and turning into thor worked there was cause there were TONS of stories with her before she became sick. They took the time to let us know who she is and why she\'s important to Thor, so when we see her sick and Thor gives her his powers to survive and run Asgard, it sets up an interesting arc. Whether the arc ended up being executed well is up for debate, but the point is that the set up was well done because the Jane Foster in the comic was well-developed. The MCU Jane Foster has only been in two out of the 23 MCU movies, and wasn\'t developed that well in either of them before just disappearing off the face of the earth after Thor 2 in 2013. So I\'m sorry, but that makes it really hard to buy not only her just showing up back as a main character again after being gone all this time with no time to let it set in, but also her somehow gaining Thor\'s powers and mjonir. Sorry but it doesn\'t feel earned. It feels exactly what it is: a rushed story concept used to make Natalie Portman a feminist mouthpiece about why males like Thor are ""toxic"". Now, there\'s a chance thay Taika Waititi and his writing partner for the movie (forget her name) will make take this storyline and make it really good. I don\'t judge a book by it\'s cover so I don\'t think that this movie is gonna totally suck without even seeing a teaser trailer. Just saying that , looking at what specific concept that wanna adapt into the MCU, it already seems like there\'s a problem with the way it\'s being done. However, I\'m not gonna make a full judgment until more informations released on the film. I like the concept of Christian Bale playing a God butcher and I like the GOTG making an appearance to show what happened after Endgame when Thor joined them. I\'m kinda on the fence with this one until we get an actual trailer. But just saying, I hope that MCU Jane Foster is improved and actually really cool in this movie, cause both the character and the actress playing her in the other films wasn\'t very good. It doesn\'t help that Kevin Feige has recently become a woke control freak who\'s showing more interest in shallow SJW pandering than doing what\'s best for the storyline of the MCU (Deadpool 3 writers replacement, making Captain Marvel leader of the avengers, etc). OMGGG I LOBE THIS ALREADY Bro I\'ve been hearing ALL this chatter about Gorr The God Butcher being in Thor Love And Thunder, and I admit that that would be HELLA COOL, In fact I Really, and I mean REALLY Want that to Happen, but its just... I DON\'T want it to happen NOW , because Gorr is a GREAT Villain, but he is also a VERY, VERY POWERFUL Villain, and in a way he is TOO POWERFUL , because in the Comics Gorr became So Powerful by Killing Gods and TAKING SOME OF THEIR POWER, THAT POWERED HIM UP SOOOO MUCH THAT HE WAS ABLE TO BEAT 3 VERSIONS OF THOR Thor better still be the main charachter In the movie time line and not the comics how is Jane going to become Thor and weld Mjolnir when Hela has destroyed it? Cap took the out of time Mjolnir back to Asgard so it does not exist in the present. All the other og avengers are kinda gone but I can see a pattern that I\'m not sure I like Thor: Love and Thunder, directed by Taika Waititi (2022). cast:\n1) Chris Hemsworth: Thor\n2) Natalie Portman: Jane Foster\n3) Tessa Thompson: Valkyrie The middle “Fat Thor” section worked soo well for this 😂\n\nNice work mate 👏🏼 LOOKS SO REAL Can\'t wait for Thor to be emasculated through the entire movie and for Jane to be perfect in every way lol so funny ngl i dont have high hopes for this being good based on what i just saw 😥Why there is a girl i want Chris Hemsworth 😖 love the old school artwork!!!!!!!!! You Sir are awesome. Respect I thought it was the real deal but it will come soon just what You know what’s interesting: Tom Hiddleston turned 40 in February 2021 while playing Loki. Filming of the Loki series was done by then, so why was he playing Loki ? And since he specifically mentioned that he won’t be part of this movie, should we expect him doctor strange? This was a trailer felt like I was watching the full movie So annoyed that Jane will be able to hold the hammer and all that, there is no way she\'s worthy like whatttt😩 Am I the only one who ship Thor and Sif?\nLike, they are more compatible for me. Interesting choice to use the fantastic beasts Official Trailer music. Nonetheless I love it I Just hope they don\'t make Thor Odi son the 2nd charecter and make Jane the Thor. I would like to see them as a couple fighting together . Kind of like Wanda n Vision. Can\'t replace thor with Jane. That would be really depressing. And Jane prob doesn\'t have a reason to be worthy, she is just a Terranian. When your female character suck so much you have to start using the female versions of existing ones Oxi colocaram a Super Girl em um filme do Thor? Como assim kkkkk The only chance that I will ever watch a lady-Thor movie is that Gina Carano will be playing the role. Some authentically strong, opinionated, empowered, fearless, real hero. No entitled SJWs petulant brats the size of the hammer. And no more shaming of Chris Hemsworth as Thor Odinson. Carano is standing up to an overpowering mob, this is the hero lady we want to see. No motorbike stealing villain with the charm of a plank, no entitled privileged snobs. A hero is somebody strong enough to stand up to media omnipotence, knowing she can\'t win, for a matter of principle. No Love and Thunder for me thank you (I know I am a white dude, your movies are not meant for me or my kind). There should\'ve already be a trailer by now since this movie got postponed like Black Widow. Used scenes from Your Highness and other movies... But it would be cool to see him and her with the same power\'s. Me, first time hearing about this movie: ""Love and Thunder- okay im digging it Jane seems to be come back thats good. Maybe we even get finally Amora as a villian, one of Thor\'s most famous, powerful enemies who also is in love with him, which would give us some interessting  interactions with Jane...\nMCU: the main villian will be Gorr the God Butcher This isnt thor love and thunder...this is JANE love and thunder. I really hope they dont just push thor to the side to randomly make jane powerful like what did she even do to make her worthy 🙄 Idk man Its just really annoying to me like I feel like she should just be a love interest and not have all this extra powers and stuff...I get she messed with the stone...but I just feel like she should stay where she is and idk forget about thor 🌚 Cause thor is off in space hanging with the guardians of the galaxy and what is jane doing? Being nosy ✋🙄 Why cant she just continue to be a scientist on earth 🔪 Thor the lord of thunder ⚡⚡⚡ Literally no one here knows the polt yet everyone is somehow bitching and complaining about Jane wielding Mjolnir but can we acknowledge that marvels rendition of zeus is going to be introduced to the mcu. I really hope this means they start to work on rather unknown concepts that have been talked about in the comics. ❤️❤️❤️ amazicaaa Portman was never satisfied being just the girlfriend even with the first Thor movie. Shes very vocal about saying girls need women super heroes. So the latest craze from marvel, captain marvel, xmens dark angel, etc has been on a mission for making every new show either depict some girl as the most awesome. Ok, girls need heroes. Its why the girl in the latest Jedi was initially hated to a degree. After all luke took time to build his character and develop when out comes this girl and shes basically Luke at his peak in one episode. LOL I mean several hollywood actors and directors are saying they want the female super hero now and not take years to develop.. In my opinion,this is how it should be...I really hope that IF Chris Hemsworth\'s contract is ending,then they should make Thor Love and Thunder\'s ending with two sons,Modi and Magni.Because,The title of Thor Love and Thunder has the word LOVE on it,so why not make like Thor\'s sons are born,right? Then,when Avenger 5 Young Avenger is going on,then maybe Modi and Magni can still represent as young avenger\'s thors,that way they wont make thor fans,like me,be disappointed... We can all bet, Thor only exists from a 2mins explainnojutsu montage at the beginning of this movie 🤣🤣🤣 If they can pull this off successfully it could very interesting. Brub their taste of music is awesome What’s the point of Thor movie without Loki? The Thor Dark World deleted scene was also there, so Loki is back? Unlike the second and third movies I hope Love and Thunder doesnt fuck up the franchise any more which Marvel seems to have successfully done ... Thor 1: Movie about The God of Thunder.\nThor 2: Movie about the hero and the ancestor.\nThor 3: A clown comedy about father\'s death.\nThor 4: A moron and a strong woman. I am so hyped with Natalie and Christian Bale it is going to be a banger! I hope this is the real trailer 🤞 Wait theres gonna be a thor 4?! 👁👁 Tbh it\'s probably gonna be shit because its more or likely gonna be all about empowing Jane to become the ""woman"" she always could become, still looking forward to it tho I want see first Chris Dada.. In this movie 😍😍 Is this an official trailer? Thor 4 virtue signaling is going to be such  a great movie. Unfortunatly there are still so many male Marvel heros around. Marvel should act in that ASAP at least bring more trans, lgbtq etc. Characters. Marvel movies  need that badly!!!! It worked fantastic with the actual Comic books and so it will also with the movies. Ya abi insanlar farklı farklı filmlerden sallama bir fragman yapmayı bırakmalı Chris Hemsworth is perfect I wanna see the story of Valkyria. When are we going to see more in Thor movies and when are we going to see more X-Men movies and when are we going to see more Thor movies that tells more of a slight love story about who he found love with and X-Men stories how they each we came X-Men when they were just kids and then now our grown-ups now Em partes eu gostei em outra não pq ele (a) ponho senas da the CW Warner Bros primeiro foi Supergirl e depois a mulher maravilha só quem tem olho bom detcta mas foi bom ta - Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) f\'u""l\'l M\'o\'V\'i""E\n𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 ➽ https://bit.ly/3r3L2v6 I for one love female representation in the expense of the main character Jane Foster gonna light it up😀\nBtw Loki is not dead... 프랫 빙고 개존멋 우리 헴식이는 말할것도없지ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ So one\'s talking about ANT-MAN being in there?!

This is not an official trailer. 0:33 That\'s a clip from your highness They used « Annihilation » frames at the beginning of the trailer and I can’t stop thinking about it Good concept trailer Great, so Loki isn\'t there.

Damn, thor is still unfit. :( Lol I love the scenes from your highness No Thor without Loki Hey look! Supergirl is in this! They did Thor dirty in Avengers Endgame. He was a fat drunk who lost his kingdom and what was left of it he gave to a girl to rule. And the part I hated the most was when they even made a human worthy to lift his hammer. Hope if Thor 4 comes they can redeem his character. You made a gud trailer 😂😂 it\'s super gud  beacause we came to know about how big fans are Is Thor half human because Tony call Thor a demigod?was it foreshadowing because gaea is the biological mother of thor in the comic book?

Is Loki not in this film ? Anyone please answer me am i the only one who only watched the thor films only because of loki????? For all y\'all complaining about Jane, she became Lady Thor in the comics. This isn\'t marvel running out of ideas, its marvel following the comic plot line. There are trillions of life forms in the galaxy, and y\'all think only two are worthy of wielding Mjolnir? The math doesnt add up.

Tom said do in an interview recently. NOOO I WANT BETA RAY BILL Please make Thor hot again some of us need that to live Supergirl really? Come man it’s not even the same universe is it official?

Hard pass... thought beta ray bill was gonna be in it.. :/ F for people who think its oficial trailer You should’ve said it was a fan trailer Where\'s anakin😂 I really hope that they don\'t make Thor a joke character with Jane being the main focus for their female power bullshit.

This is Loki from deleted scene from Thor The Dark World. WTH Very gd fan trailer bruh there is literally supergirl in the begining hahaha...so wont work. Just as she-hulk will be pants too. I\'ve nothing against females in the marvel universe, blackwidow, gog, all good. But capt marvel was absolute pants and these will be too. habis ini lahirlah anaknya. yaitu combat thor Its official This whole teaser trailer shit is starting to get on my nerves now! Like why we  you havin\' announcements for announcements? Bro eppo bro varuthu Todas las películas de thor son muy sencillas y con una exageración de comedia x/ I m thor fan my best hero hollywood movie best of best hero thor Why did they play a scene from supergirl? its a Teaser trailer not an Official trailer :/ Where is Gorr? Yeahhhh new tralier REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE wait thor is old BUT?!?!?!??! Oh his not dead I dont even seen a tor fight scene Arnab b like : kuch bhi kuch bhiiiii this won\'t b tolerated..Nation wants to know 😬 Is it me or Thor is getting crappier by the movie? What is the name of the background music? wtf its that real? Wow, another fat Thor movie.....awesome Is this the real or just edited Aun están grabando la película xd UMM THAT WAS SUPER GIRL IN THE BIGGINING? Bingoo! Thor is unique, no God can be doubled. Jane\'s character was so boring in the first 2 movies. There is no chemistry between them.  Instead Tessa and Thor rocks the scenario. I just wanna see thor not that women. Nice editing Very 80s bollywood is getting so extreme in trying to rapidly instill female super duper characters. Not just some powers but the best and greatest most powerful ever! lol. each mavel or comic book movie is doing one overs on the next female super being...I think women have a complex issue...... wow congratulations Egh\nMight watch it, might not. Why is marvel making everyone worthy Nice editing Guys this isn’t an actual trailer I dont know how but them have to make a avenger movie where it is thor agenst al Nice edit bro this is real? 0:05 looks like Melissa benoist Rune king thor The only thor movie that performed well was Ragnarok, because jane foster was not present in it . I honestly don\'t like the character it just feels so forced romance with thor. Even loki has a better chemistry with thor than jane. Loki was the only reason I watch thor movies I literally skip to his scenes. But if he ain\'t gonna be in this movie, then I hope the movie flops like srsly😭😭😭😭😭 I hope , the film doesn\'t go like this 🤦\u200d♂️. Ant Man is here WHERE IS LOKI? Spoiler : Thor will become unworthy............... Es el martillo No one give a damn about a Jane foster thor A woman, great 😐 good idea trailer! but not real trailer So they want to replace thor now? Why is that he\'s not dead is he Jane Foster is the worse part of the thor movies, this will be a very poor addition. Is jane villain here????? Cause I\'ve read it from Google it says that she\'s the villain.. IDK.. I hope not You Know What Christian  bale is Also in the movie Thor: Soy and Blunder Nossa o cara ñ sabe nem fazer um trailer de mentira direito The beginning is from another movie Old thor Pissed off how all these females are coming to Marvel Universe now, it\'s ok but all at the one time.  Got Thor, Ironman, She-Hulk, Captain America,  Black Panther maybe and Captain Marvel.  Possibly more as well Natalie Portman does not deserve the role cool Are these just diffrent movies mashed together if she is worthy- istg how is she worthy AND THORS OWN BROTHER ISNT what the fu- Carrol shelby and ken miles! Bye bye thor How tf is this not real. You just have got a leak because some of this footage isn’t from any other movie This is the end of an era for sure. Marvel just had to put the nail in the coffin. Ignore everything Odin told to Thor and continue with this. The comic was terrible out of all the comics which could\'ve been used to go forward, this??? Come on man. I don\'t care about politics I care about marvel. Just keeps getting worse and worse. Just seeing my childhood being burned at the stake. Just look what happened to Loki he wasn\'t even the main character. Not bad. 😀 wait a minute thats thors girlfriend Chutiya bna Diya 😂🤣🤣🤣 It’s filmed in Sydney Marvel rly becoming big joke. I knew when Disney got them that they are going to ruin them and all started with Endgame. They are just replacing all Avengers with womens, instead Hulk we will have she-Hulk, instead Captain America, that Superman knock off Captain Marvel, instead Iron Man we will most likely get Tonys wife as most likely Iron Women, instead of Thor we will get Jane (like WTF) and they killed of only Female OG Awenger Black Widow. Scarlet was so great in BW role and they just killed her of for that Woke poster girl Brie Larson because she want to be the only ""strong"" women in new Avenger movie. And not to mantion that huge joke that Valkyrie is a new Asgard ""KING""??!! and that she looks for a queen . That was the biggest BS i have ever heard. I am just glad i can choose what to watch but it just suck that now both Marvel and DC are going with full Woke rute. Black Widow, Falcon and Winter Soldier and depending what they do with Black Panter that movie also are the only Marvel movies i am going to watch, if they go with female Black Panter after just one movie then i wont care about that movie so it will just be first two. I just dont get why Disney are going full WOKE rute, they must be hiding something rly dark when they are trying to please Woke culture. I wont watch this shoit for many reasons  if its real Lol does anybody else recognize the background music? cough Crimes of Grindlewald cough cough that taika waititi music again Very good edit I like iit :::::::::,? Lol its edited man😂😂 4,5 milion views for random videos from a few movies....i need to change my profesion Is this real liam neeson the best zeus เดี้ยวๆ ปีหน้าเลยหรอ😂😂😂😂 Marvel nadie quiso a Thor mujer te recuerdo su cómic más popular es literalmente cuando se murió de que nadie la quería boa aroto a montagem fo boa parabens . mais iso ai nao vai da certo Desnecessário!!! Is this real Plot ? anyone ... JAJAJAJA CASI Nice edit Now they\'re trying to make Jane a hero; already lost interest.  Marvel is turning the movies to bullshit. ❤️ and ⚡ Só uma montagem tosca, não percam o seu tempo! banger Thor 6 múi giờ thành 1 múi à. Ăn lắm bơ sữa quá nên mất phong độ quá huhu Looks preposterous I\'m confused. Nothing was explained. Like si solo has venido para ver si thor va a estar gordo o no My ears have been assaulted by the sound of this video geez Natalie Portman just ruined this for me.  Thank Oden this is not real. THIS IS A FAN TRAILER Nice edit Loki???? неплохо так то NOPE NO FEMALE THOR Cap? The Real Batman Christan Bale Is Villain in This Movie 😎 adam\'s water nononono pls donot... pls.... chose other one PLS..... Disappointed. I expected more. TÜRKLER BURDAMI? Its now digger and thunder No ideas what it\'s about. y el trailer donde esta?? Natalie Portman is about as bad an actress as Haley Berry! 0:05 Supergirl Soy el único de mexico aquí? Marvel is the Best Han han real funny is not love and thunder trailer you mixed up all the movies 🥴 nice joke bro This movie will fail and like Emma Stone and ScarJo, Natalie Portman will sue disney and marvel for their box office failures. Im losing me shit here LOL!!. solo partes cortadas de otras pelis Why oh why did he get so fat?\nHe was so hot before🙁 All mix video 😂💚👍 which is the bgm Even though this is not a real trailer \nIdk if i will like this if this movie become whole jane with pinch of thor and no LOKI well i saw cast and there is no loki where is that hug, wheb will sun shine on them again when will they reunite  plz marvel just give us a movie of just thor and loki THE BROTHERS PLZ Nice edit lmfao Ok it is not about Thor any more why is super girl in here wtf Dimana tempat liat nya ya Where is thor The outro 80s Musik title  ??? Yeah yeah it’s a comic plot line but you can tell Disney is really going to be shitting on masculinity for a while. Gowokelosefans is it real Chutiya bana rahe ho sabko kaha hai trailar sab pehle ka cut scene hai Phil movies Ka clip home dikhata h Not seeing this until Disney fires KK Lmaoo nice 0:05\n Superigirl xd Happy birthday Good. I wait for love from you 💝💖 Dea ethara etiting வேல vana Where is Gor? Just, no. Good nice AT THE start is a stolen scene from the movie ANNIHILATION, this ain\'t the real Thor trailer! Sale like ke lie kuch bhi kar skate ho.\nIsi lie main you tube par kuch bhi nahi dekhata hu. \nAbe thor ki tino part aur avengers endgame ko mila ke thor 4 ka trailer bana hai.\nWah moj kardi Bruh loki is not dead Cagaron a Thor Локииии где:(( you just take many video from another movie...that is not a concept...

I saw like 5 different movies in this trailer 👎 Fat Thor Confirmed. Manaus-Am \nLigado com vcs ! Это же нарезка из разных фильмов( You edit with thor old films ugh. More Girl power nonsense 😆😆 how da fck Annihilation came from???? aww You mean Super Simp : the movie. Looks like trash. His love should’ve been the hulk This is not real thor love and thuder trailer Im NOT paying for feminism onde eu acho treilers realmente oficiais poise stou cansado dessas merdas !!! BAAAAADDDD sorry is thor trailer or Jane Foster trailer ??????????????????????????????? Just no. I don\'t know about this stuff bc I didn\'t read the comics. Do they give the powers of the Thor to someone else? Just like that? If so that is bad. It depics the role of Thor. It makes it like job you can give. Like Thor is no God anymore but just a person with the power of Thor. Also Nathalie Portman is hot and shit but I think you all agree that Chris Hemsworth is the only Thor like Hugh Jackman is the only wolverine. Sometimes men just are better after all I search this in goggle and isaw all cast and saw hela where is she ? Propaganda bem enganosa em! Smite the movie Thor Flop and Thunder What the hell thori 🤮🤮🤮 I don\'t like female Thor Still fat shaming men I see. Tut tut. And using the Thor name to trick people into seeing this I really wanna watch it, and I am but Jesus why is the trailer so shit. Report misleading I don\'t want to be a racist but don\'t you guys think that mcu are giving too much attention to the female characters that every iconic character like thor is to to be a women. I know that the hammer isn\'t thor\'s power but almost everyone is able to lift the hammer. I understand why cap could do it because he was a honest and didn\'t hide anything from anyone after the civil war. Like you don\'t have to make everyone female to support \'women power\'  :-o türk yokmu gardaş ♾ Бред a marvel esta acabando com os super herois, quem diria o hulk mansinho e tirando celf com crianças en shoping center,  thor virou um palhaço  so faz o povo rir fora que em todos filmes tem mais cenas comicas  com super heroes, que o cinema inteiro da mais rizada do que curte as cenas de açao ...Anti-disney, and there version of a ""marvel universe"". So glad there marvel movies are dead and are being long forgotten Oh Jane Sale ullu bana raha he Oh a thor movie not really about hmm no thx Thor still fat?? Oh no first thing, THOR is not a girl. they cant change that, Am working at a viking museum and have done viking stuff for 11 years. am gonna be mad if that happend. it is just wrong. it is so many other aaser you cant pick that is a girl, but stay away form Thor. am tired og marvel changing all boys to girl. and i know it is gender blabla. but not replace them, just add inn more. it kinda ruined the whole thing with just eks taking ironman to irongirl... or thor to jane. i dont care if they add more superheros, but i dont like that they just replace the old once marvel is my favorit, i hope they dont ruined this Türk var mı ??? Say it be 4 say it again keep kids stuff on my space and not tube you..god Please please please let this movie be good and not suck. это не тор 4 держи дизлайк ** waste of time what kind of game?? Using clips from your highness cone on Where. Is. Black. Widow. Disney. I’m not buying it This looks so bad, I have no faith in this movie at all.

GEEZE these trailers are getting WORSE and WORSE. They either Completely SPOIL the whole plot, or DISREGARD it. \nI know nothing about this movie that I didn\'t already know. Why they can\'t make a good new thor movie  without  a ""strong"" woman ,this gender shit fucks me up Soon.. wait y is thor fat till now this aint gonna work.. Why don\'t they do something original instead of the same old gender-swapping. THIS IS GOING TO SUCK. es una basura!!! ni siquiera es un tráiler real Já vi que será uma merda This is not a true trailer They keep making everyone worthy it’s kinda annoying like Jane wasn’t that good of a character they should give it to someone else like his brother some how or something but Jane was just boring but can’t change it Vai  ser uma bosta kkkk Forget seeing this movie after Tessa Thompson\'s racist interview comments. actually a deepfake Not orignal this is fack👍 Hmmmmmmm 😒 Por que es chica wtf,this is joke???

Ass Guardians Por qué todos ablan en EnglIsh Iski to Que mentira mano nem é verdade muito ruim🤭🤭 I dont like thor Nada ver esse trailer Are they going to mix match all the movies together that marvel studios made and are they going to mix match all the DC comics movies have made so far and mixed match the characters going against one another on each other\'s superheroes find other superheroes and other villains from marvel studios and then DC studios going after one another and marvel studios superheroes and villains mix match villains antics ridiculo.  Varios trechos de diversos filmes feiao Yes Actress Malayalis assembly BLACK WIDOW • Opening Scene 🇺🇸 🇷🇺🔻\nhttps://youtu.be/i7cAiX0ninw Watching this, I\'m sad that we didn\'t get to see more of Odin in combat/casting spells, or of him riding Sleipnir at full speed.\n\nThat would have been awesome. This Trailer looked so real, i thought my grandma came back to life and started eating pudding We are waiting for Thor: Love and Thunder Me hubiera gustado que Loki apareciera en esta película de Thor love lol real Thor trailer won\'t have such a dramatic background music for sure. Masterpiece editing 👏 love and thunder. LOVE YOU THOR Who else want to see guardian of the galaxy in thor love and thunder Possible unpopular opinion: Not really looking forward to Natalie Portman taking over the roll. Especially after she snubbed the sequels to the point where writers had Thor make jokes about how they broke up and she\'s no longer around. Deadpool 3, Matrix 4, Venom Carnage, John Wick 4, Thor Love & Thunder, And a damn good Batman movie 🙌 fantastic editing.... great work When you come in early, it feels like you\'re part of internet history. Anyways, the logo has always given me a 1990s vibe How hard is it to put concept in the title No one:\nMarvel: We\'re going to make Jane the new Thor, even when eveyone hates her instead of giving Loki back 🥵👍🏻😁 It\'s gonna be epic Great for a fan made trailer...I hope the production values are better than Ragnarok 🙏 They better take this chance to play BLOOD AND THUNDER BY MASTODON 🤘⚡🤘 I really like this special look of Thor Love and Thunder and showing a few clips from first Thor movie and Thor: The Dark World and overall i really love it and I\'m looking forward to see it in 2022? Looks cinematic...however it’s more than obvious this is a fan made teaser trailer Me la creo cada vez que vengo lpm Will Thor go on a diet lose weight and get in shape? Or will we get fat Thor? That\'s the pressing question everyone needs to know! I feel bad for anyone who believes this 🤣😂🤣😂 Thunderstruck would be a fitting music here What if Freya comes back to life in this movie considering she is the God Of Love, i know its high expectations but with the title being what it is it would make sence Dude this looks soooo fan made. I hope they put loki in here. But being that Tom is working on season 2 its not likely. ; - ; The Mystery of why Jane Foster broke up with Thor has been revealed this week.... She\'s not interested in men with little scrawny bird legs. Come on bro. You should be given an Oscar for clickbaits.♥️😂 ah nice cant wait to see the movie soon Is it just me or is anyone else getting the feeling Chris Hemsworth isn\'t going to be the same this movie they pushed him hard I love Thor but anyone getting that feeling? Zues and Odin going to be on the movie….. can’t wait to see how this plays out. It feels like he put a bunch of clips together We are waiting for the real trailer I have a feeling that Valkyrie might make Jane her queen. Like what if Jane actually became  lesbian after she broke up with Thor. Maybe Valkyrie and Jane will fall in love and she will be Valkyries queen. 😁🥰🥰🥰 Thor hammer suits perfectly i wish thor get his hammer back Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) f\'u""l\'l M\'o\'V\'i""E\n𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 ➽ https://bit.ly/3dQNboE Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) f\'u""l\'l M\'o\'V\'i""E\n𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 ➽ https://bit.ly/3dU0l3X Will we see the Guardians of the Galaxy in that film and how much time?

Ya tendremos pronto el trailer de No way home en una conferencia no lo se voy a buscar mas investigación pero si  tendremos el trailer de ¡ No way home !!! Al fin Spiderverse confirmado!!!! Mas información like porfis 😉😉😉 I am so excited... Well I’m just waiting for the real thing Wow that movie looks so good I cannot wait for this movie, although it does seem like they are using scenes from the other movies... Um excuse me....please fix Loki\'s mullet back the way it was. Thank you. Love EVERYONE Just say its a fan trailer !!!!! Im tired of this misdirect, I love this trailer Every single scene in that trailer either from Thor,Thor The Dark World,maybe Thor Ranarok,one of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies or Avengers Endgame God of Thunder\nLightning: Am I a joke to you? They actually put the word concept on the previous Thor 4 FA made trailer Pretty sure the trailer won\'t have the old asgard in it I\'m waiting favorite hero thor Thor, captain America and iron man are the most powerful Avengers Thor: Love and Thunder | (Official Movie Trailer) CONCEPT  I\'m glad I don\'t have to make these. Putting ""concept"" in the title sounds so difficult Bro, atleast say its fan-made in the title the trailer isnt even out yet so i feel bad for all the people who belived this He got me for a slightly second Multiverse can distory mcu they need to make all cherecters in one if they dont make multiverse this should be better They have to use the boys are back in town for this movie I feel bad for all the people who clicked on this thinking it was the actual trailer.... So, is this a real trailer, or fan made? It\'s pretty much all clips/lines from past movies, which is exactly how fan made trailers get made. Nothing notable that\'s new, which is what I\'d expect from a real trailer. Dude at least give us some REAL content here Thor Four: More Thor So... will loki be in this movie? Another fanmade, put it in the title Guardians of Galaxy renamed as Asgardians in The Galaxy 😂 Was there even a single second of new footage in that? i like thor My Fav Hero THOR⚡⚡ Yes guys the real movie Is coming out in 2022 it\'s a real movie but this is fan made What did you use to edit this? Fan made but interesting By Odin\'s beard!! hahahaha, so this must be thor 4 trailer?? So Thor 4 is like Thor 1... we aren\'t stupid, we know this is not thor 4 trailer!! ♥️ Is this real teaser? 2022?!? WTF we can put a man on the moon in less time. Who do you ship Thor with?Jane or lady sif Showing only clips of previous films isn’t a teaser trailer for something new 🔥 Thor: Love and Thunder (2022) ❍ Fúll M-ö-V-í-é ❍\n➲ https://bit.ly/3bdRn09\nSubtitles Available Can you just put fan made instead of official trailer please 😠 So the title says Marvel Studios, but the almost exclusive use of old footage suggests a 15 year old who just bought their first editing software. If you don\'t have footage, don\'t release a trailer. Laaaaame Maaaan I thought this was official good job u took the thor the darkworld movie and said it was love of thunder Atleast Try... It\'s a Taika Waititi movie... It can NEVER be this dark. Marvel really needs to stop coming out with such good movies like wtf is this Recycled scenes from the previous to Thor movies, mixed in with some new or previous deleted scenes. 🥱 not bad for a fan trailer; lazy if actually a Marvel official patch-job Falta agora é  o trailer do doutor estranho multiverso  da loucuras Atleast he not write \'haters will say this is thor trailer\' 🙄 Pongan que es un fan-made,no mamen XD I hate “concept trailers”! Trash baiting people into watching such a poorly edited mess. I wish there was an actual punishment for every one of these claiming to be a legit trailer. Any real marvel fan should be pissed at this rn It\'s completely wasted, these are old trailers, expecting love and thunder trailer OK with everything, but why are they trying to embed Greek Gods with Norse Gods. I thought they had a understanding, Norse Gods for Marvel and Greek Gods for DC. I love thor male😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 This is a ""special look"" at stuff we\'ve already seen. So lame, I hate when people do this. I hope whoever made this steps in dog 💩 today 🙏 Wow this so real trailers that my dad came home EPIC \nSaludos 👋 😄 This is the real trailer? \'tis not a teaser trailer, it\'s a recap. you lied to us. -__- Please, give us official content.

Wow amazing editing 😂👍 The only thing new with this trailer was the last clip when Thor was flying through the bifrost to that one planet. Which was awesome. But everything else about this trailer SUCKED. Just rehashings of past movies and voice overs. Boooo!!! Trailers nowadays just be putting together clips of previous movies Loki in Thor 4 and doctor Strange 2 ❤ Too old fashion fan made concept trailer imo. This is cool but just put fan-made in the title. Down vote!   Honestly, what’s with all these “trailers” that are put together using clips and sound bites from old movies? I wish they would just come out and say this is fan made crap[ It\'s just scenes from past films! Chick thor will be so much more powerful Han robado 2:03 min en mi asiento ._. Why do they expect us to believe these? Imagine using scenes from other movies litterly Whats the point putting together snippets of cuts from previous movies , seriously Teaser Trailer🤔\nYou mean a montage of other films\nYou’re havin’ a laugh or desperate for clicks/likes Going woke eh?

Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,"['eOlV7SoQCH4', 'gPDOJ92DTbo', 'Bae6HLf9Qys', 'vvFybpmyB9E', 'Luq2aEeRoKQ']","['Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore Let us pay our respects real quick to the people who thought this was the legit trailer for the third movie Fun fact: The least successful harry potter movie did better then the most successful twilight movie Muggles are not lesser. Not disposable \nI love this line ️ Hits me in the feels This movie definitely won\'t be the same without Johnny Depp his version of this character can never be replicated and it\'s sad he was replaced. As much as i love Mads Mikkelsen\'s acting (his Hannibal is great) I won\'t ever forgive them for replacing Johnny Depp. He is the perfect Gellert Grindelwald. The Fantastic Beasts film I\'m looking forward to is the last one where we\'ll get to see the epic duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald As much as I like Mads Mikkelsen, I still want Johnny Depp for Grindelwald. Bring John Depp back.... That\'ll be the right justice to him.... No but when the actual movie trailer and movie come out, I\'m going to watch it immediately.\nI fully believe that Dumbledore singlehandedly killed all the people who died during both wizarding wars, as well as being behind his sister\'s death. \nDumbledore could have prevented so much pain and suffering yet he didn\'t. I still don\'t understand why they stopped taking jonny deep. Jonny deep was the perfect grindelwald. Irreplaceable please in the fourth episode again with jonny deep I’m wondering if we might see grindewald have a vision of Tom riddle or if we get to see young Tom riddle in the whole fantastic beast series Man that nostalgic bgm still never fade away Can\'t wait for this!! Now I eagerly await the trailer. 2:54 the BGM gave me Goosebumps I can\'t wait anymore. I wanna see the trailer  I\'m kind of interested in this prequel Me: I read the title\n\nAlways me screaming: GRINDELDORE ️ i cannot wait for this !!!! This isn\'t a clip for fantastic beasts 3, its clips from crimes of grindelwald, disappointed, we already knew the film was going to be secrets of dumbledore, but pretending to have a clip for the movie was dodgy Johny Depp to Warner Bros - ""You have to trust me when your every instinct tells you not to""\nAnd they didn\'t trust him but they want us to trust them. Although he is my favourite actor and I admire him with all my heart, all of you that gave up on these movies and don\'t wanna watch them and support them anymore only because they fired Johnny Depp, you aren\'t true Potter fans. These movies are bringing up all the old memories and magic from the original movies, and yall don\'t appreciate it because they had to recast the character? Damn... So we just need keys to unlock dumbledore We are one step closer to seeing Warner bros ""FANTASTICALLY"" fail at this project without Johnny Depp. We Want Johnny Depp Back. I’m all for a Dumbledore origin story, but how does this relate to the Grindelwald and what Newt is up to? This trailer is just FB2 rehashed. RIP to those who thought this was a legit trailer hahahaha i just want johny depp back.......man even looks cool while waving his wand..... Pretty sure we a months away from release. Even if it’s terrible, it will be great. If someone told me that this was the trailer for the new movie I wouldn’t even know it wasn’t Sadly we wont see johnny deep again as Grindelwald And here I thought the new Harry Potter movie was the cursed child ...\nI would really want it to be the cursed child it would be so gooood Secrets of Dumbledore is just Harry Potter books 1 to 7 Why is Dumbledore teaching Defense of the Dark Arts (Boggart Defense).  He was a transfiguration teacher.  That\'s like a math teacher teaching how to conjugate verbs. The Johnny Depp\'s replacement reminds me of Dumbledore\'s replacement in Harry Potter Will be giving this one a miss. Should have stood behind Jonny… Isn\'t this the same room which lupin used to teach them boggarts? Fun fact this is fantastic beasts 2 not 3 …… I can\'t even imagine it without Johnny Freaking hate Amber , we want Depp Aww  sadly it\'s lacking of deep characterize and inconsistent plot, in a half of its sequel showed lastrange family scene that neither fit with entire plot nor the upcoming movie like is it necessary ?\nthe movie\'s hype when its pre-staged because many \'A\' stars involved but when it\'s aired they don\'t seem like they were, just because it has many \'lead actors\' in limited screen time so what\'s we expected then ? If not for my respect of JK Rowling I would refuse to watch this sequel.  That does not stop me from not giving any money to Aquaman 2. #JusticeForJohnny I am happy they replaced Depp, he didn\'t give me psychopathic vibes, and I want everyone to remember him as Jack sparrow not grindelwald.  Boycott aquaman. \nThey had to replace him because he lost his case (no matter what, he lost it) and ambitch won, and they continued with heard because she won. It is better to play safe and avoid all the controversies.  Just Boycott aquaman. OMG I\'m so excited Johnny depp and the guy who plays the main character were just horrible choices for casting Ooh, common plz bring JD back. No one can be better than JD for the role of Grindelwald When is ready this new episode from FANTASTIC BEASTS? Somebody help! the title sucks.... it feels like calling ""the prisoner of Azkaban"" ""Sirius\'s escape from Azkaban"" or calling ""The half-blood prince"" ""Snape\'s secret book"" Love the trailer but wish if johnny was there Without Johnny Depp, what\'s the point in going to see it If your on the line wondering if you should like dumbledore or slander dumbledore like me…this movie will be the final facts for the choice and I know it the secrets of dumbledore: we know them already It would be great if they got Deep wth yhem as the cast like originally anyway still happy and i rlly can\'t wait for the movie to come out If you have seen the first two movies it is impossible to mistake this for a real trailer.. Wait when is the trailer coming out it took me 2 mins to realized i saw this movie already. can\'t even tell what the plot to these are tbh Johnny Deep is  great actor in the world Everybody a gangsta until Amelia Watson appears in the film to help Newt. A trailer to reveal the the new movie title that is revealed in both the video\'s title and thumbnail. THE only way for having jonny depp back is we don\'t go to watch the movie, we don\'t buy the movie, we don\'t care, let see  if the change their minds! FANTASTIC BEASTS 3!!!  2:54 i’m crying missed it If only this was an actual trailer, but it would be a good trailer for crimes of grindelwald though Whatever you say, these ones lack that sense of charm old ones had. Waiting for HARRY POTTER I hope they are finishing for the deadline but they want to make  a premier for the Cursed Child also... I am sure they will procrastinating this for the shake of that no replacing jonny depp. he was special in that role. im probobly not going to watch the new one. i fell in love with the series after the 2nd movie. Wait is this the real title of the third movie?! Oh that BGM  This is the trailer of the 2nd fantastic beasts film isn’t it Im like wtf then i AlREADY seen the 3rd one  Só consigo pensar manoooooooo!!!! I believe Dumbledore and Grindelwald had a love affair I thought this was fake because I\'ve seen too much fan-made trailer lol I am confused... is this for the second movie? Just curious... Did they bring back Johnny Depp? I wont spend a cent for this movie for removing a victim Johnny Depp from his deserved role. Can not believe they Did not bring back Johnny deep for the 3 movie You know it’s fake when they keep using parts from old movies Boycott fantastic beasts 3!!!  Bring back Johnny Depp!! 0:10 seconds is all it took to realize it’s fake Might I ask why most if not, all the trailer was, was shots from Crimes of Grindelwald?\nVote. Grindel-WALD,\nor. Grindel-VALD? ️️️ The books say dumbledore was the transfiguration teacher not defence against the dark arts...... It was all started with a Wizard Steve Irwin. Where did they reveal the title of the third Fantastic Beasts besides in the title of this video? We need to Jonny Depp ️️️ Oh Yes is 2022 Coming Soon Only one legend -: Jhonny deep ️️️ Don\'t understand why people won\'t just put fanmade in the title Jonny Depp is also in this movie Dude: totally misleading.  I was expecting a trailer for the 3rd film No Johnny Depp no franchise even if I\'m curious as hell about this. #BoycottFantasticBeasts3 sorry Eddie and Jude. Why do the effects look cheap? I thought the budget was insane for this saga What reveal, this is just the trailer for part 2,little bit misleading.. this is not the secret of dumbledore this is the crime of BRING JOHNNY DEPP BACK Its false!

As well as this is put together, it is a thumbs down from me for catfishing people with wrong information. It is clickbait! All of this scenes were in other films of fantastic beasts LMAO That’s was just a trailer of the 2nd movie Not without Jhony Deep, easy Skip #JusticeforJohnnyDepp Does no one realize these are all clips of the old.movies? Well, that was a waste of time. 3 minutes and 44 seconds that I will never get back. Nicholas ? Is that Nicholas Flamel of the sorcerer\'s stone ?  No thanks! #JusticeForJohnnyDepp Фейк.

I AM PISSED OFF RN!!! tidak seru, tidak ada harry potter dumbledore Trailer in Hindi can you dumped in Hindi to learn in Hindi can you dump this trailer in Hindi dubbed in trailer in Hindi can you dumped in Hindi in Hindi can you adopt district in Hindi dubbed in Hindi So pure clickbait Fakeeeee. This trailer is for the last movie that came out few yrs back Sorry but johnny depp is my grindewald you tricked us JobLO Let us say there are a lot of idiots out there making us waste our time! The second movie was boring as hell, made only slightly better by Depp\'s performance. So, we should expect this to just be boring without Depp. IF Edward Scissorhands is not in this movie then im not watching this garbage pile Whoooooooooo Oh boy Horrible title in my opinion. Just saying Alert !!!!!!!\nThis is fake trailer clickbait!!!! Harypoter 3 Its the old trailer fkkkkkkkk wtf is this? well... ปัญหาคือจะได้ดูมั้ย nice fake Njirr SCAM BKL DUDE Wb Wizerd cool but jk rowling sucks Perr Fake  LOL what a fake trailer I don’t think the key to success is to make #3 more ‘epic.’ It’s all about storyline and characters, in my opinion. #2 had lots of splashy effects and visuals, but the storyline was confusing, took place in too many new locations, and didn’t grab me emotionally. I hope WB focuses on the basics of good storytelling this time. I think Mads its a perfect fit for Grindelwald, unfortunately the change of actors at this point is gonna feel a little iffy. I love Johnny Depp but he didn\'t particularly bring anything exciting to the role. I am going to watch it no matter what anyone says. I have waited so long. I accept that Johnny Depp played such a good character but it is what it is. Also it\'s not like that wb is at fault because they changed(modified) the screenwriter for the sake of this film.  Although he is a central character but he isn\'t the only one. There are plenty of other things good actors and interesting characters.  Without depp…not gonna watch this show…he gave the real essence to the Grindelwald  character Warner bros, get Jhonny back Mads mikkelson is a good choice 👍 For me personally, the series has ceased momentarily when they kicked Johnny Depp out! Johnny Depp for ever! 💕💕💕 No Johnny Depp no money to see the movie Warner! Sorrynotsorry! Can\'t wait to see Mads Mikkelsen. He should have been cast as Grindelwald from the beginning. Not gonna see this movie. Gonna take a stance with Johnny. Hope they\'re still casting Johnny Depp the positive: they can literally just say he used a spell or potion to change his appearance\n\nthe negative: JK being so vehemently antitrans makes me wanna skip it regardless unfortunately PASS!!!! WB ain\'t getting a whiff of my money after the J.Depp debacle. I swear on this! Mads is my second favorite actor of all time, if anybody could replace Depp its him....I\'m beyond happy that he will be in the 3rd movie! We need Depp Mikkelsen seems to be the ideal replacement of Depp. Of course, it is not good to change an actor a of main character, especially if this actor is Johnny Depp. Congratulations to everyone who comes in every single second... Bring back Johnny Depp.💪 ROWLING ROCKS FOREVER! Seriously if Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was turned into a movie... I\'d die! no depp? dont go to theater and just pirate it. jack sparrow would be proud. Ok yes sad Johnny Depp is gone, but Mads Mikkelsen is an awesome choice. Better than Johnny imo. He looks younger and compliments Jude Law as a love interest more lol At first I wasn\'t going to watch this one in theaters because Depp wasn\'t going to be there, but Mads Mikkelsen is a really good choice so I might go watch it Warner bros will gonna lose a lot of fanbase of this sequel for sue without depp people can\'t think about it....you can take away his money, you can take away his position even you might even judge on his character and criticize him for his behaviour but one thing you can\'t take away is his talent and love from die hard fans👿 respect his acting skills afterall he is The Captain Jack sparrow 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 For the last time everyone , Johnny deep was asked to step aside by Warner brothers due to his ongoing legal issues , so Warner brothers recast mads mikklelsen to play villain gellert grindelwald Lmao wb have ball of steel if they think they can replace Johnny deep 😤😂 rip WB In today\'s episode of our #KinoCheckOriginals we give you an overview of everything we know about Fantastic Beasts 3: The Secrets of Dumbledore! Dumbledores the true star of the show anyways.🧙\u200d♂️ if you google the movie, johnny is listed still but i know it’s not legit :( Depp\'s performance was not good at all, it was just him doing the same character he does in all movies all over again. As a Wizarding World fan I am thrilled that Mads will be taking over, this gives hope that the rest of the saga might be actually good No Depp, no watch Hell yeah i am hyped!!! Are there any secrets we DON\'T know about Dumbledore at this point? When there is no deep, no soul in it..so not interested in it. Choose your side Griffindor or Slitherin I do like that man Mads but he ain\'t no Johnny Depp ! I guess I\'ll watch. No Depp, not interested. Get a grip, Warner Brothers You guys kicked Johnny depp out and expect me to go watch this movie? I rarely comment but this one does trigger me. No thanks. Won’t even watch the trailer and give you guys views. Won’t even talk about this with anyone. Fantastic beast and where is depp? Johnny Depp is still a better actor I’m not watching it because no Johnny Depp Johnny depp has been recast as grindelwald as his wife lied about him hitting her No depp! no money! from me. wtf  is  this  thing  with  Johnny  Depp ???????  i  really  dont  think  that  he  counts  quite a lot  in  t his  movie  so  FO  with  this  guy No Depp. No watch. No Jonny Depp WHAT WHAT Well I am NOT seeing this next chapter . JOHNNY DEPP IS INNOCENT, BRING HIM BACK I just want Newt to stop being the lead in these movies, he really sucks. No depp not interested its  a  big  fat  NO  from  me  !!!!!!!!   didnt  like it  at  all เหลาไม้กลองดันได้ไม้กายาศิษย์ I Promise I Am Not Going To Watch This Movie. If There\'s No Johnny There\'s No Movie No depp , no movie Hey I\'m remember fantastic beasts So this is not a trailer?\nrubbish I’m surprised they made this movie since the woke mob has gone after Depp and Rowling for different reasons. so it happen welp depp will be missed The saga continues People may plan all kinds of things, but the LORD\'s will is going to be done.\n\nProverbs 19:21 GNBDK. ❤️.❤️❤️❤️❤️ jhonny?

Avatar 2,"['Axmg1E4HrVE', 'Lf3EgO6zo-A', 'CmSc_EIqyQI', '7OvjiVEhbSk', 'KjMN0GAQJls']","['Avatar 2 I never thought I’d see a AAA Avatar game, but I’m all for it! Ubisoft PLEASE do not mess this up, the game has soooo much potential :) Imagine creating your own character and it being a full open world experience. Could this be what I\'ve been waiting for all this time? All I really want from this game is stunning graphics, multipe creatures to tame, and a decent character customization so I can look like myself lol Ubisoft, on behalf of the fans of Avatar, we REALLY hope that this game is everything that we want it to be. This game could be amazing, and we hope that the storyline, graphics and environments are just as stunning as we hope for. Avatar 2 is on the way Oh wow this looks INCREDIBLE! Cant wait to see more!  I\'m beyond psyched for this. Absolutely love the movie, probably watched it at least 100 times. Nevermind the gameplay style or the graphics, as long as the story is good and I can really immerse myself into the world, that\'s what I\'m there for. Depending on the quality I\'d easily pay $80 for it I think having a multi player addition to this would be awesome, being able to fly around with your friends defending pandora would be such a great experience. I love single player open world games, but this one seems like a good one to play with other people. •Collect the seeds of the Tree of Souls (2/100)\n•Connect with the trees of Vision (1/35)\n•Destroy human bases (5/21)\n•Gather legendary animal hides (4/14) This is honestly what made my childhood, thank you to the people that made the game series. Avatar has a special place in my heart. Story and characters are amazing This was unexpected, awesome Can’t wait to dive into this world again. The first game made me feel like I was there. I want to be immersed again I adored Avatar as a kid and its stuck around as one of my favorite movies so watching this made me feel some type of way! Haha, I will run around this game for hours just for the world alone, hope the rest of it is great too  This game is going to look incredible, and then it’s gameplay is going to be ubisoft Bravo to every vfx artist involved... extraordinary renderings! Just played through Avatar the Game, so now I am super stoked for this!!!  I am gonna rewatch avatar now I wonder if we\'ll be able to play as the humans as well. That would be quite fun. Remember kids: Wait until the gameplay trailer. Remember The Crew E3 trailer? Remember the Assassin\'s Creed trailers? Ubisoft is great at making beautiful glorious trailers. The trailers also rarely represent what you get with the gaming experience. I see so many people getting excited and optimistic. I want to see this actually become something the trailer itself promises the gamers. But I know Ubisoft too well and see this as becoming another project that falls short of what we are led to think will be the experience. This game needs to be immersive as hell and have an amazing, vibrant open world, fighting needs to be perfect and flying and riding mechanics need to be smooth too and look great like the movie, story also needs to be amazing along with a lot of rpg elements like customization and upgrading yourself at the tree of souls or something, ai needs to be perfect, focus more on making it immersive and have a lot of attention to detail this game can be amazing for years like red dead 2 and gta 5 but way better if done right, if you have to wait acouple more years to make this game amazing than wait we’d rather have it perfect and ready than have it be forgotten because it wasn’t done properly Watching this makes me so excited until I remember it’s Ubisoft so expect: always online, tiered loot, cosmetic micros transactions like non other, game mechanics from every other Ubisoft title, feeling half finished in terms of content at release.. Great graphics and audio! Fast paced storyline... Looks like a winning combination. Kudos! I am REALLY looking forward to playing this game it looks AMAZING. I honestly think Avatar lends itself really well to Open-World exploration/ action adventure games. The world is so vast and varied and we\'ve only scratched the surface of it so far. I really hope this game does well as there is so much potential in this universe for untold stories, unseen places and brand new ideas overall.  As a avid fan of the movie, my first thoughts are ""I\'m so hyped"" but then I remember not to get to excited. Pls, if you\'re going to do a game on this beautiful world, do it right. But I have this overarching feeling I\'m going to be highly disappointed. But until I see a gameplay trailer, I hold out my hopes for this. its 100% gonna be full of climbing large towers, freeing camps and bullet sponge enemies once they are 2 level higher If the game looks exactly as shown.. then by God this is the most awesome thing I\'ve seen this whole year If aerial combat is really like that in game, that would be dope. Hope a gameplay trailer comes out soon. wow i never even considered how awesome a video game this movies world would make, but i am impressed looks amazing. Lowkey wishing this game breaks expectations and be actually good. One of the best movies to make a game from and it\'s going to be released 12 years later. Pandora is a such an immersive beautiful world so hopefully Ubisoft lives up to recreating that. Imagine if we see an avatar town, where we could spend free time when action isn’t happening  The music the visuells and the sound design is already incredible Ubisoft really is Great So....the environments look real, and this looks like its rendered in game, the character animations and textures stick out like a sore thumb amongst those absolutely jaw dropping environmental visuals. When the next Avatar game comes out before the actually movie lol Avatar is my favourite movie ever. Finally after more than a decade of waiting, we gonna get AAA Avatar game! Please Ubi, don\'t mess this up! Avatar, the game, the actual potential for this is mindblowing I can\'t wait to play this amazing game. I have been waiting for a long time to experience such an avatar game..... WOW...!!!!! Looks good! I played the first Avatar game through twice, would be nice to see the environment with modern graphics if I have the necessary hardware. LOVE IT!\n\nI cant wait to play it. This is what I\'m excited for.\nHope I would be able to explore areas of the map. Including those from the first movie :3\nI can\'t wait The last scene gave me Goosebumps ! I am surprised that not many people have even heard about the first Avatar game from Ubisoft. This looks like a massive upgrade.. looking forward for this They say it\'s gonna be an open world game, but I also hope it to be an open story game with many possibilities that change your storyline. For example, you can play as a Na\'vi or a RDA soldier, but hopefully you can also play as an Avatar, join a clan, learn the Na\'vi culture and do the Iknimaya rite of passage and choose your own unique banshee. It\'d feel more complete to me instead of dropping in as a Na\'vi character that\'s already a clan member and thus already knows stuff (or is supposed to). Can\'t wait. To the Devs/Project managers involved, PLEASE take your time with this!!! Open world, character customization, great graphics, multiplayer open world, and many creatures that you can tame. That’s what I want. Would make this game amazing. Would really love to have this degree of a game, with details and all, where we could play as the animals in this game. It would be sick! I know people won\'t agree with this, but this needs to be made for VR and done well - not a crappy port like Borderlands 2. I could live in this. Can\'t wait to have to climb a bunch of tall trees to unlock more of the map to complete all the sidequests like every other ubisoft game if this game has some level of customization for the character or the flying thingy it would be sick af This just makes me appreciate the quality of cgi back in 2009!  ️ OMG I have always loved the Pandora Universe! If this game turns out to be an open world game where I can interact with the plants and animals ( like e.g. taming a dragon or horse) and it has a FLEXIBLE Story where I can choose from extremly many options of what I want to do ( like in medival dynasty) and not you need to do A so you can do B. And if the main thing is NOT fighting against the enemy, aka if it is not like a classical battle game, THEN I TOTALY WANT TO PLAY IT!!! Looks awesome! If this is anything like the movie, it\'s going to be incredible looking forward to seeing the next Avatar movie. An avatar open world is all we needed, I\'m so hyped! Love this can’t wait the movie suppose to come out net year too I like how they are showing more of the fauna of Pandora Really hope they get this out on computer as well. Hate console. Looks so stunning Imagine if they add multiplayer to this! The film was SO awesome, SO beautiful... and I can\'t wait for this game Looks like a faithful sequel to the original game solo espero que continúen con las historias de Raider, Jake y que profundicen mas la historia de Harper I\'m not crying, I just have a James Cameron in my eyes Omg I\'m always looking at the Grass tree detail it\'s really amazing  I remember I had the first Avatar on PS3 and it was my whole entire life, I would literally skip school just to play more Graphics and visuals are next level excellent video game, simply spectacular.\n\nI am going to think that the best thing would be in 1st and 3rd person also online multiplayer that each player chooses pve mode or pvp mode and that the creatures are tame.\n\nwith that the perfect game is left, with those characteristics I buy it at all costs. Imagine it in VR  Damn, this might come out before the actual second movie does. I always wanted an Avatar game!! Just hope Ubisoft dont screw it up  When it comes out, I\'ll live the life I\'ve always wanted to live. Can’t wait for this and the sequel, both hopefully next year as well, omds I would really love yo have this game with a mmorpg mode, that would be great, im very exited for this game Yooo, this is awesome, I\'m so excited for this to come out. The detail  Omg this looks insane Боже мой как же это прекрасно,очень реалистичная графика 0_0 прям вау)) The storyline can wait, I\'ll be exploring Pandora for a couple of weeks for sure. The moment I watched the movie, I dreamed of someone making a game of it. One that really focused on the environment, exploration and the connection of life and unity the movie carried with such care. Didn\'t expect Obisoft to do it...\nPlease don\'t botch this. the first game was phenomenal now please please make this even greater It is so realistic! I mean the graphics and all...for the first few seconds I legit got confused if it is the trailer of a movie or game I really hope they invest a lot in this game and keep updating over the years to make it better n better I have waited for years for an avatar game I loved it after watching the movie Iv\'e been waiting 4 years for this ! When they first announced the project, i didn\'t even think it was a game just some kind of spin off tv series... Wow, this is a dream come true :) Honestly I dont really care what the real game is going to look like. I\'m going to play it because Avatar is my favorite movie of all time. oh my god YES!!! as big avatar fan this so amazing and can’t wait! I hope they add VR to this game so it can be like you are on Pandora! I am super excited for this game about my favorite movie!!! So many years since I played Avatar The Game...I need this This game won\'t be complete without James Horner musical score️ a true masterpiece! The game is probably going to be released alongside the movie next year I guess. Would love to be able to play this in VR This has to be like a horizon zero dawn style, and if it is im in it ! I can remember there was a Avatar the Game for Ps3 and more. I would love to have a remake of that. Because that game was Awesome. I hope this game will be good as well If Ubisoft pulls of everything perfectly with this game ,it\'s gonna be a revolutionary game Can’t wait for this to look like every single other Ubisoft game, with different textures I fell in love with Pandora back in 2009 & here I am 12 years later freaking out about the fact I will be able to explore the lush, gorgeous world of Pandora for myself! Thanks for the surprise Ubisoft ️ Yesss this was my childhood  I remember the ps2 times playing this beautiful and annoying game hahah , they upped the graphics good for them  Love the world of Pandora, so I\'ll be very interested to see how this turns out. I\'ve always felt like Pandora would fit an open world game more so than a film. i hope we can play as the space marines i was rooting for them in the movie Massive entertainment going to nail this! Can\'t wait Awwwwww can\'t wait!!!! \nI just want to explore the map! Crazy how the game might look better than the first movie So excited for this! And if you are going single player, why not also go for open world Multiplayer (like ESO), that will be epic, provided it has some good quests & no hick-ups I hope this game is worthy of the world Cameron made and isn\'t just Far Cry: Tribal If this game is capable of being played in the next gen psvr, I’m sold. I don’t really enjoy Ubisoft games, I feel they lack quality over quantity, but avatar is one of my favourite movies and if it works in vr, entering the world through the machines and flying etc that’s gonna be amazing! I really hope it has 2 campaigns, 1 for humans and 1 for navi. Wont be much of an rpg if were limited to one race Ok, I actually quite liked the original Avatar game because it had moments where you could just chill out and appreciate the scenery lol i remember played avatar the game on the PS3, this game was bomb, definitly gonna buy this one as a person who loved the movie despite it\'s shortcomings, I\'ll probably enjoy this game... I\'m so freaking excited for this game. I know I\'m in the minority here but Avatar is my favorite movie. I\'ve seen it over 50 times. I bought my Xbox 360 back in the day just to play the first game and put hundreds of hours into it. This was made for me. I hope they add VR to this so that it can be as if you are on Pandora Everybody seems negative on here but I’m actually excited for this game. Ik we didn’t get a full gameplay look but the last game was almost above average. I really hope this game does the same, I want more customization for animals, and your character…and a new storyline. Yeah! Can’t wait to watch avatar 2, 3, and 4 and play this game after! It has to come out in the third person to be able to appreciate the character among other things such as the appearance of the character painting clothes. The fundamental thing is that it can be put in third person and Spanish audio with these 2 much more people will play if the game has third person and Spanish audio This looks so good I’m gonna cry I always take these trailers with a grain of salt. Hope the graphical quality with the real thing will be as good as the showcases Alright. Was not expecting this to be a game trailer, but really welcoming.\nI hope as well as many they don\'t mess this one up. Kinda hoped it was a 3rd person game though. After playing BreakPoint I am confident in the world-building for this game. Now Ubisoft just listen to players if it launches weak and all will be ok. Looking forward to trying this. It\'s gonna be one of those games where the first look is nice, but after playing it for 1hr you have seen everything. Game looks gorgeous It looks amazing beautiful  In all honesty, I wouldn\'t mind if there was a separate Halo War type mode included with this. I think that would be super fun This game takes me to a journey into the past when the movie just released This is so epic, it comes out same year as the second movie does EPIC I loved the PS3 avatar game, as simple as it was. Can\'t wait to play on PS5 now Im waiting impatiently for this game and the movie next year. The potential of this game is enormous, but I just hope they\'ll do something proper with it. This looks so good!! Don\'t care if it gets delayed for 9 years, I just want this game to be a masterpiece If you can describe beauty, this is the  game! I wonder if you\'re going to have the option to choose if you want to be Navi or Human. If they added online, I\'d enjoy fighting in the skies like the trailer shows. HOW DID I JUST NOW FIND OUT ABOUT THIS??? I’ve always wanted an Avatar game that was actually good!! I can’t wait! now thats awesome!!! hopefully you can be military or avatar in a multiplayer world as well! it should be easter eggs galore in that open world! as well as crafting and building with a health simulation system! Hey UBISOFT are ya reading this! I kept forgetting this is a video game This has the potential to be so dope, love the concept of the Na\'vi. Can\'t wait. I\'ve been waiting...so long for a game like this..BETTER BE ONLINE TOO One of the rare games where the setting itself will carry all the weight. Pandora must be one of the most awe-inspiring and beautiful fictional places, and you couldn\'t pick a better time to make the game, considering the huge recent advances in the visual department. Hope the story and the gameplay is good, as well. Looks freaking awesome.... If an Ark:Survival trailer and a No Man\'s Sky trailer had a baby this is about what I\'d expect. Since Disney and Avatar is partnering with Ubisoft to create this game I would expect something amazing. yeah when this comes out ima sit out cod and battlefield just for this game, Ubisoft dont mess this up please Ubisoft, its a humble request that please don\'t screw this project up. Avatar is not a concept or movie or just mere a game, its an everlasting emotion for us. After the first game they made being somewhat playable and not centered around transactions, I\'m sure they can pull it off again with THIS much more room to work. First person or no, it\'s going to at the very least be a stunning game world. I would love to play as a human like I used to do on the old game, and please let us customize our armor and guns Love to live in a place like pandora. I really REALLY hope this will be a massive improvement over the original I played on the XBOX 360 If there was ever a game that should have 1st person VR comparability, it should be this Wow I cant believe ubisoft made a game just for me <3 Let\'s hope they can come up with a meaningful open-world game, set on my favorite fictional planet. I\'m totally hyped for this. Looks absolutely stunning! Is this a bunch of cut scenes or actual gameplay footage? ALREADY FINISHED ALL THE MISSION 2 YEARS BACK .\n SEING THIS VIDEO AGAIN MAJW ME FEEL TO START IT AGAIN️ If ubisoft puts the effort in, they can succeed. The only reason they\'re not considered one of the better studios is cuz they keep using the same game formulae /structure for every single game . Their games are gorgeous to look at , fun to play , stories are alright , open world\'s amazing to look at although most of the time they\'re just a big open map of nothing or filled with copy & paste quests . Even then their farcry series is so much fun to play even though they all feel kinda the same . So, if they can innovate and create something new  from ground up , it would be fantastic .  If they can create something like uncharted where it is quality over quantity , fans will be much more satisfied with the final product. it looks like a movie but its a video game, IM SO EXCITED! =D GOOSEBUMPS  The original Avatar game was my childhood favourite, I can\'t wait for this to be released! I was pretty excited at first until I realised that it\'s gonna be first-person. Can\'t wait to climb towers in Pandora for synchronization I’m excited for this! game looks amazing the faces look slightly off i cant tell what it is but otherwise looks amazing Ok dream come true!!!!! I\'ve literally been a fan of AVATAR since its launch and even played the game and all i needed in life was AVATAR to  make an epic comeback and here it is. <3<3<3<3 Ubisoft ur doing it ryt This has to be like a horizon zero dawn style, and if it is im in it ! If they make it right this game has so much potential, online could be AMAZING. This game COULD BE NEXT LEVEL God bless the person who has to follow up James Horner’s incredible score! Excited for this game i hope we get to play as both factions kind of like the avp games where you could be pred, alien and human. also wonder if this is gonna be multiplayer? Yea this game is gonna be definitely top 10 in 2022\nMan.....how time flows I want Ubisoft to make Avatar 2. If this game delivers then I’m all in. But I’ll wait until release to find out because I’m not preordering. finally something straight-up entertainment so Ubisoft, is it gonna be ""Far Cry: Frontiers of Pandora"", or ""Assassin Creed: Pandora""? imagine this game beeing vr headset compatible it would be so cool Unbelievable & amazing   This does look too good to be true, after so many games Ubisoft have made with the same formular that has become very apparent in their latest releases, people are less and less blinded by hype from the lessons learned from bothced game releases. Still hope this is gonna be good though. I would so love to see this on the Oculus Quest 2! OH GOD!!! \nI can\'t wait to ride a Toruk Makto\nThe trailer gave me goosebumps Avatar is a rather special franchise... It would work better than well in VR! \n1) The idea of the movie is to order Avatars on Pandora via special boxes... There we would be in our living room, we put on our VR helmet and we leave REALLY on Pandora!\n2) The game is in the first person. This is sick I loved played the first one on psp I played has a kid was one of my first games and I loved the movies tho I don’t know why but I always loved avatar hope they don’t mess the game cuz I’m definitely playing that gonna say it once and for all: no pre-orders. Let them deliver first! I can\'t wait to play it All of my brain cells just blew up. Pls anyone ,when are we gonna get to play this masterpiece . I\'m so happy my childhood is back\n2009- now 2021\nI have the game Xbox 360\nI miss this  movie before I was as a kid Ubisoft, please make a breathtaking game out of this. I always wanted a game with flying islands and fantasy elements, and that you combine this with the Avatar Franchise is very awesome! We can trust ubisoft in terms of gameplay ,  story and themes I remember back when 3D films was a popular trend back then, Avatar was the one movie everyone had to see, wearing those polarizing glasses. But I remember that time watching it and being the happy kid that I was. Seeing this trailer brought me back to that time. Happy vibes, and I really hope this game lives up to that potential. this as its actually something i wanted for a longtime now and i actually thought about it everytime i watched the movie growing up. this as its actually something i wanted for a longtime now and i actually thought about it everytime i watched the movie growing up. PLEASE MAKE THE GAME A HIT BY BRINGING INTO THE REALITY AND IT IS A POWERFUL STORY TO INFLUENCE GAMING INDUSTRY  GOOD LUCK....WISH YOU GIVE ME THE FIRST CHANCE TO TRY OUT  It will be great if ,In the future we might play this as a fully vr enabled game , like the ready player one. I wonder if you can choose sides. I loved playing as the humans with the mechs I wasn\'t expecting to love this so much! The music just makes this trailer even more beautiful! I got chills watching this ️️ Can\'t wait to play the game and watch the movies ️️ Pleeeeaase don\'t disappoint us!! You can do this Ubisoft I enjoyed the first game years ago. Let\'s see how this goes. Yes so exicted to see this the first game had for that time real good graphic and was so good and now its a new version with better graphic and hopefully also good Cool video!\nHopefully, this will be a game someday. This looks fantastic! Can\'t wait to see actual gameplay. I always thought that Avatar is a better concept for a game than for a movie Ubisoft really did something special here. Haven\'t seen a trailer for a game this good in a super long time. That being said here\'s my list of wants:\n\n1. Robust character creation I would love to play this game Ubisoft fazendo  um jogo dessa natureza? Só eu q acho que isso não vai dar certo? ... N sei se está nas capacidades dessa empresa não \n... mas torço que consiga...promete finally my childhood fantasy coming true I can’t wait ! I\'m seeing a lot of things in here that weren\'t in the film. Maybe this is giving us a glimpse into the sequels that are (eventually.......) coming? Imagine the suspense and scary vibes when you find alone in the forest and a Panther or a beast comes out... that’s so cool! I love how we\'re all trying to keep our expectations low here, lol. :D I can\'t wait to explore those forests I have never been THIS excited for a game before in my entire life Hate the game or not, but Avatar the movie was one of the the best movies I\'ve watched Uyanga Bold needs to be in the score for Avatar 2 I remember how gorgeous the first game was on it\'s time. Here it goes again, who would have thought? I\'m really hoping this is good, since it\'s from ubisoft and using snowdrop I\'m expecting significant graphical downgrades before release already, now will it be a far cry clone or an ac clone? Please don’t mess this one up  we’ve waited too long to be disappointed Waiting For Avatar 2️ Looks like the bits where the man Navi looks at you while you pet that big animal and the part where you slide and that arm comes up from first person pov, might be semi accurate for actual gameplay. I have a feeling it might be exclusively first person, which isn’t something I enjoy in open world games, but I’ll be getting this regardless. This is going to make fine addition to your other open world games.\nHere\'s hoping Beyond Good and Evil 2 launches alongside it. Oh how I wish the game is as mindblowing as the trailer. Only reason I have hope for this game is because they\'ve been developing it for 5 years. Which is odd for ubisoft I know people complaining about this...but when the movie came out this literally feels like what i dreamed of when i wanted a game for the movie in 2009, a first person experience exploring pandora or maybe even playing as the humans but i don\'t think you can do that with this and like i know ubisoft blah blah blah but still i maybe happy with this as its actually something i wanted for a longtime now and i actually thought about it everytime i watched the movie growing up. Looks great! Hard to imagine how they\'re gonna make a game out of that. finally my childhood has returned well a little bit at least So beautiful  I would\'ve love for this game to be made by Rockstar I’m so hyped for this game Avatar is a incredible movie can’t wait to see what this game has in store along with the movies in the future Finally something to play after AC series by Ubisoft I love the concept of US being literal aliens I do hope we get to play as Marines too Remember when first looks actually had gameplay in the trailers? It\'s gonna look nothing like this when it comes out. Looks great, but Ubisoft has a history of 10/10 ""cinematic trailers"", then shipping a game that looks 5/10. You know what\'d be interesting if we could choose from which perspective we would play the game I played the 360 version so much the disc burnt, can’t wait to do that with this one Imagine there\'s a VR option A ""Ubisoft"" game, will look amazing and fail to deliver There’s no way it’s going to look like this Remember playing the first game they release, and what a blast i had with that game! Such a shame it died out, guess it\'s time to reinstall the game and play the game again. And watch the movie. \nDeffently gonna buy this with out a doubt! Jaw dropping  God I hope this’ll be good. I always wanted to ride one of those flying creatures Idk why but i got a feeling that map will be huge. Amazing  Thought it was FINALLY a trailer for the 2nd movie but if the game ends up being as good as this trailer (which, let\'s face it, isn\'t very likely these days as we\'ve seen with a bunch of other games) I won\'t say no.\n\nGiven the rapid decline in movie and game quality in recent years I highly doubt it tho. It would be cool to use the AMP suits again, I’d have a blast i was like “ finally they created a new gen avatar game” but then i saw the ubisoft logo and i got mad asf the first person feature is a very wise move as it stands for exploration it gives depth to the experience Was excited for the game until i saw Ubisoft is making it Esta película refleja porque al ser humano no se le puede conceder el poder del universo antes de evolucionar espiritualmente , es necesario dejar la maldad atrás If this graphic is there on console it will be awesome I really hope it’s not only in 1st person, and I especially hope it’s not just a far cry copy and paste, do this amazing movie Justice Ubisoft. I would love this on the VR Oculus Quest This looks really cool and makes me feel hyped for Avatar 2. I’d love it if we saw Colonel Quaritch in this. Please don’t mess this one up  we’ve waited too long to be disappointed i rly loved the first game (mostly the RDA campaign) but would have liked a tad more better gameplay for marine (like aiming, recoil and other shooter stuff)\ndon\'t rly know what to think of this one yet\nbut ehh, not sure i like the idea of not having RDA/human campaign I hope the game will look at least like the trailer. I know games aren’t as high quality but I really hope this one will be Within 12 years... They can now make a game that looks pretty damn close to the live action Avatar. There is still something missing that makes it look as good as the movie.. but its damn close... After Cyber-scam 2077 I lost my expectation from new games. I highly recommend Horizon Zero Dawn. This amazing game is almost same as the Avatar movie. The only difference is you\'ll see ancient gigantic A.I. creatures instead of alien creature Ubisoft: “Fine. I’ll do it myself.” I need to play this game because of Attractive and Playable game and this video is also amazing. Definetly one of my most anticipated games since i heard a rumors about it, thank you Ubisoft. Finally an assassin\'s creed game in space i can\'t wait to climb a high place to unlock the next region on the map What a creation and VFX it\'s a great film. hats off JEMS CAMRON sir u r my inspiration please tell me we\'re gonna see Pandora\'s biomes that aren\'t the Jungle or Mountains i.e. Deserts, Oceans, Great Plains, Coniferous Forests, or maybe the Polar Regions Looks awesome They took their time with this one and right now it looks so worth it THIS IS SO EPIC LET\'S GOOOOOOOO I really liked the old game too, and if it\'s going to be at least as good as that, or better I\'m down. This could be the best game if made right I really hope they smash this Lindo d+ Across a thousand worlds we fight for our survival\nThose who would tear Humanity down are legion.\nOur forces are few, our enemies - many.\nThere is no respite. There is no mercy. I\'m sooo hyped  This looks ridiculously good Aight so now this is the only game I\'m half expecting to be decent now since ethe rest of Ubisoft no thought a moba would be a great title for the series. Seria bueno q tenga las 2 opciones en tercera persona y en primera ya q si no tiene tercera persona la mayotia de jugadores no les gusta They should provide this game with extra VR effects HS this looks so good! When does this come out to theaters Speechless. This looks like a beautiful game and cannot wait to dive in It\'s been a long long time this game had been mentioned again good thing i wish it was a survival game like rust and conan exiles I can’t wait for the “trailer vs release” video comparison :-) I can\'t wait! Needs both 3rd and 1st person firefights. 16 Vs 16 multiplayer alongside 2-4 player Co-Op. An open world twice the size of Origins and Odyssey combined. 2 stories 1 for humans and 1 for avatars. The ability to bond with everything. A single player campaign that revolves around the 1st movie. No invisible walls or world barriers. The ability to start your own tribe, hunt, craft, and survive in the wild. No DLC alienation and community splitting. AI bots in PvP. Resident Evil 4 style QuickTime events. Weavers one liners. 5+ hours of cutscenes this good looking with no loading screens. It would have been perfect, with a blend of assassin creed I’m just happy to play as them Imagine if this was a VR game instead. Please don\'t ruin this game with typical store bought items like ""time savers"" Amazing  If you can play as the humans and do some good old space colonizing and the game isn\'t terrible, then it looks appealing. I played the original Avatar game. Never really bothered playing as the Na\'vi, only ever played as the RDA. Felt like the RDA had more development in game play. Hopefully they flush out the Na\'vi more in this game, and if they do let you play as RDA, not have it be so one sided in gameplay mechanics Damn can\'t wait to play this at 4k HDR dolby vision 12bit 150 inches at 90hz with an atmos audio config. This would be amazing. Well, we know it\'s not going to look anything like that when it comes out!!! I don\'t know why just watching this is getting me excited for the sequel movie This game looks awesome is it guna be multi player :) and co - op story mode ? I hope they make it so that you can choose whether to play for the avatars or the humans i already know ubisoft is gonna mess this up but im still hoping on the 1% chance that they dont Ahh great! Some new trees to climb and another billion collectibles that unlock entirely pointless equipment or anticlimactic storylines!\n\nPeople should wait a year so Ubisoft have time to decide whether to patch all the bugs or not! I am excited for this game I hope it’s for the PS4 This is breath taking, seeing one of my fav movies getting a vid game is just wow….. Please have a RDA campaign like last time. I can’t wait to play this game like I did as a kid Warning: don’t take the cinematic trailer too seriously it probably wont even look like this Just waiting to hear about micro transactions for a Toruk and a Bow that glows might as well kill all hopes now that this will be a noble and honorable gaming experience This is just Is this real or am I dreaming!? I literally thought this was a movie trailer at first Please do not disappoint us ubisoft ️️️️️ I hope you can pick the bad guys too, although i know its not gonna happen haha We all know that Ubisoft can make a great cinematic trailer, but what about the game? It would be amazing if they made it online too tho just please keep the graphic, or/and release it in vr  this is gonna be awesome Aside from the game absolutely not looking like this on release, i really hope its first person. Too many open world games go the 3rd person route and that just kills it for me. At least give us a choice. 3rd person games are a massive downgrade in immersion I can\'t wait!!!!! This looks INCREDIBLE. Man i\'ve lost count of how many times i\'ve watched Avatar, it\'s my favorite movie of all time. You know what would be epic? If this was both Far Cry and Assassin\'s Creed combined, Third Person, Freerunning, with vehicles The new Avatar movie looks good. 1:12  I thought i\'ll be getting a pet simulator ... but then i took an arrow to the knee ...\n\n... and got war !  Cameron - I\'ll wait another 10 years and release a new Avatar\n\nUbisoft - it\'s time Can\'t believe Gordon Tompson (the game wiz) worked on this game. I can see where his glorious hands have touched. OMG! This looks so promising! PLEASE, Ubisoft, tell me there is no spared expense here! There is only one way to do an Avatar game – with great effort and care for all the details. Anyone remembers playing the OG game where you could choose sides? I really hope we can play as both humans & na\'vi, it would be kinda dull if we could only do one. It would be even cooler if we could side with the humans as a na’vi as well as side with the na’vi as a human. This animation was in another level.. BEAUTIFUL! So excited ️ No matter wat i will play this game.. The 2009 is still Great to me this day Fiiiiinaly after a looong time it finally came Interesting! I wonder if they\'ll let you play as the RDA again, like with the first Avatar game. Would be cool if you could play a  human who sides with the Na\'vi, like Michelle Rodriguez\'s character. Soo   amazing  Can’t wait for this game  I waiting for avatar 2 movie...  I really REALLY hope this turns out great. If not then someone else better try and make an avatar game because I’m begging for one so glad its in First Person. I really hope this is similar to the old avatar game just on a much much larger scale on next gen It would be fun if it was like the og game where there are sequences in which you played as a soldier and a blueboy. I have always wanted to reinact the final battle from Avatar in a game I\'ve been waiting in Azkaban for 12 years! Can\'t wait to play as the RDA I hope it\'s gonna be like mass effect I’m a HUGE FAN of avatar I cannot wait for it! Super cool, but we will see how it really looks in the end. Why the hell have i never thought of how much potential an Avatar game has. A surprise but a very welcome one ! Pandora is like the most beautiful place you could possibly imagine filled with strange plants and animals and also floating mountains and one of those flying creatures, but now the soldiers wants to destroy everything, and that\'s why they will go to war for PANDORA just like in the movie, Hope we get to play as RDA Mercs. I think this will be good against all odds. Waiting Eagerly waiting for this. Please do not make this a RPG, the story could be LEGENDARY This is actually looking really promising... The graphics are stunning!!! I was actually excited, and then I saw that it was the Pandora Avatar, not the last Airbender. ^^ Awesome  campaign should be like the movie, be pretty cool The faces could look better. But the game looks promising Imagine if it had multiplayer humans vs Navi I wonder how many towers Ubisoft are going to make me climb this time. Amazing Ubisoft makes the best open worlds When avatar 2 comes I’m gonna watch then play the game when I get a ps5 Those arrows was too strong, they must’ve infused it with Haki ! Wow, Finally Trailer Of Avatar\'s Game. I hope they give us the option to play in third-person. This gives ne goosebumps. Now this looks like an Avatar game, the first game wasn\'t very impressive compared to the movie\'s world, this truly seems to live up to the organic and living breathing environment of the movie Sooo, we\'re supposed to climb radio towers, collect valuables, seize control of settlements and then finally work our way up to the boss, right? Right. Amazing  Now I get the true explanation why there was no part 2 of the film. I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THE AVATAR GAME and then I learned that it\'s about the blue cats. Not the real avatar :( Iam waiting for over 11 years of Avatar 2 This is literally my dream game, please be good!!!! Hopefully is a nice game! If can play both either human or Avatar would be nice :) \nIf open world game, that would be more awesome this game could look good on mobile tbh im so sad i thought this was a movie trailer for the second avatar but this is awesome to ig XD You just know this is gonna take full advantage of the dual sense controller Looks good! When Ubisoft releases Avatar content before the films seeing trailers as good looking as this one is just sad nowadays, knowing ubisoft it\'s gonna be an empty shell of a game.\n\nsuch a shame It is beautiful Please be out on PS4/Xbox One we need this This look f amazing They could do avatar last airbender, the game phisics would be amazing to see Let’s be honest here: We all know it won’t look this great at all, but we want it anyway :D I\'m really hoping you can play as a human, would take much fun in flying a scorpion guns blazing in to a pack of dire horses I hope we get to play as the humans vs the navi and friends of the forest UBISOFT - as always, they are the Best!!  I haven\'t gamed for years, but if this ends up being multiplayer with humans vs Navi I might break When does it come out ? Just imagine is Rockstart made this, it\'d be on another level. 제발 제대로 나와줘 ㅠㅠㅠ A ""Ubisoft"" game, will look amazing and fail to deliver imagine 2 different stories to this, like you get to choose to be a human or an avatar Если будет 1/10 представленных животных, 1/20 похожего гемплея, и хотябы 1/4 графона, то получится игра от Ubisoft. Главное не сглазить Epic  Think it\'s gonna be forgotten about pretty quickly much like the film itself. Make it right please.\nI will buy it for 100%, because I love this film, but I want to have good feeling from that.\nMake it similar like in movie (big map, lots of places)\nMaybe multiplayer, that could be interesting (human vs na\'vi). Imagine hunting for the biggest flying creature in this game, like in the movie the old game was fun to play ..\nnow this game looks appealing as all hell.\nlol im deffo up for a avatar/ assissans game id be happy as to traverse the avatar world with.\nnew gen graphics. This gives me Turok evolution vibes, i miss that game Wow amazing films ️️️️️ Itsatrap! Salute to our comrades those had fallen for ANTHEM ( including me ) ! Pls tell me im not gonna be the only one who will get the game just for thw wildlife I\'m happy there is another avater it\'s annoying for people that doesn\'t have a ps5 or new xbox consoles but this looks awesome Can\'t wait to watchhhhhhh\nThis isssss amaaaaaziggggggggggggg\nWhat aaa graphic! What a view! \nJusttt wowwwww Damn, wish it wasn’t first person, but still hyped for this. Pandora is such a beautiful world i want to be on the human side just to prove how quickly they would actually die I hope that we will be able to play this game in 3rd person.  i need to buy a ps5 just to play this game, OMG. i\'M iN loVe... I hope they at least release with physics like RDR2!!...  Like water splash, damage marks etc unless it ll be cyberpunk too ️ oh god i wish that i could buy a ps5 to play this game Loved the original on ps3; still have it. I can only imagine this game is going to be 10x better Yall better make it look as good as this trailer This ought to be good .plss ubisoft  Wonder if we can make our own avatar in this game\'s objective - go to the enemy outpost to do something Damn got to make this a complete set of the movie and the game,... Giving me nostalgia for the old 360 game from when i was like 8 cant wait for this to come out. Ubisoft: you can play as a blue Alien. \nMe:\nNow is the time, Men of the Empire, to unite - for we face our ultimate foe. This can be a rare case of the movie being better then a game. Bring the new movie already! No Words!! How the world is developed  Man, they really nailed the bioluminescence of the night. if this is gonna be first person, it will have so many far cry elements If Jake and N\'tiri are in this as a cameo, I\'m going to love it. \nI hope the flying mechanics are decent too, I\'d loved to fly like they did in the movie. Ubisoft, do us a favor and dont mess it up. This game prolly has so much potential and will be really successfull, so don\'t ya dare to mess things up The last avatar game was perfect also Waiting ️️️ I was hyped then I remembered Ubisoft is making this game If this is happening, the next movie is probably coming out around the release of this. I\'m sure I\'m not the only one who\'s waiting for the next Avatar movie   No words. Huge respect to the team  I hope goobisoft doesn\'t mess this up but I also don\'t trust them enough to not mess this up. Beatiful game god work ubisoft Imagine it being an online game where you and random people are just playing basketball and flying around as a 10 ft na\'vi lmao whos here watching this to get a sneak view at what the star wars one will be like Omg it\'s gonna be such a masterpiece just like the old game \nI already miss those days when I played it It’s just going to be a more beautiful version of Horizon Zero Dawn I HOPE that there is a Vr coming to ps5 and you can fly on the bird things because I would be doing somersaults in the air shooting arrows at everyone going AYAYAYAYAYAYA I WILL DO MY AVATAR FOR 4 HOURS STRAIGH I ALREADY KNOW IT Я смотрю этот трейлер в лесу , капец атмосфера I CANT WAIT I dont know why, but they minimized the most promising thing about this game: It\'s being developed by Massive Entertainment, the same team that did Far Cry 3. Between the team involved and this being a exclusive to next gen, I think this one could be really amazing. Everyone worried that the game won\'t look that good because it\'s not gameplay  - don\'t be, it\'s ubisoft, it\'ll be a stunning game. I\'d be more worried about other things I remember the first Avatar game, you could choose between being human and na\'vi. And gameplay for each of them was different. Shame it\'s not the case here, it could have increased replayability. It\'s a game???I wanna play in this!️ I hope you can create your own character and it’s multiplayer online Bro I’m excited for this cause I went on the ride on animal kingdom and  got the firgiereen and I’m so damn cause remember this since I was a kid No way we got avatar as a game dope Can\'t wait This is my dream game An Avatar RTS game honestly would be cooler. this should be a good one! remembered how bad the first avatar game that ubisoft made. Well of souls, blue lagoon, i hope those places would show up Imma be mad if this game don\'t live up to its potential Y’all Looks like I’m definitely going to have to get a PlayStation five Because I’ve been really been wanting to get a PlayStation five Unexpected but absolutely AMAZING\nFinally Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is reality! Too much gameplay on this trailer OMG !! I\'m so hipe !! We know we can glid it\'s incredible !!! would\'ve made so much sens if insomniac or naughty dog made it,this is the kind of thing they usually make. I remember the first avatar game. This is literally the 2nd avatar game, probably a sequel to the 2009\'s avatar the game Please, I beg you, let me play as a human, i really want to pilot these badass helicopters and the C21 Dragon Seems like a 1st person game hopefully there would be a 3rd person option too In this universe, will I be able to choose to be a native Na\'vi, or a human that connects to an avatar and as I progress I can have the option to become native or just connected? Remember kids: The game is NOT going to look like this, not by a long shot. I’m more than sure this is the in-game footage. One thing I did wonder about is if this game follows what happened at the end of the first avatar game from PS3 and Xbox 360 For real thought this was a movie for a second before I seen the word game in the video ️ Pls dont mess this game up. It looks very promising, but Cyberpunk did that too This feels like horizon zero dawn \nWithout machines I\'ve been waiting for Avatar 2 for 12 year and I\'ll see the game maybe sooner. Super glad I have another 18 months to buy a Series X, I think it will be mandatory. Beautiful ... Anyone know if it will be co-op or online multiplayer? At last a place we haven\'t managed to completely destroy yet AMAZINGNES!!! Hey Ubisoft, do us a favor, don’t make this game only first-person. Take a page from rockstar and give us the third-person perspective as an option alongside first-person. Please don’t mess this one up  we’ve waited too long to be disappointed If this game isn’t exactly what i want it to be, you will be receiving a strongly worded email. I wish for Massive to develop World in Conflict 2, but looks like this will have to do GOD BUT THAT GOOD GAME!!!!!! They need to make it where you can be either human or Avatar (I don’t know what their called) I wish you could play as both sides I can\'t believe I finally got the trailer! The first Avatar game was good for its time, I hope this will meet our expectations  Can\'t wait to explore Pandora more widely, the underwater world is especially interesting tho i REALLY hope this is a open world survival game! [chances are it is not a survival game but it would be really cool if it is a survival game] please have a third person option... this looks too good to be just fp... :( \nkudos to the team, your efforts arent wasted <3 Pls don’t forget to make the story and gameplay as good as the graphic or you will be forgotten. After 2077, I can not hype no more. This is amazing, but it’s UBISOFT, we all know how it ends unfortunately. It\'s really an alien invasion game where the invaders are humans. Ubisoft never learn do they? Not touching this at least a year after its release, when this destined to be mess gets at least halfway patched, and all of the hate from the downgrade settles down. Can\'t wait to tame my ""Toruk Makto"" I will say man, huge respect for Ubisoft for working in some unique games. Hope you can play as the RDA like in the last game. Looks interesting, and better then the other Avatar game we got lol. 1:54 EPIC!!!! the game looks awesome, but I\'m disappointed it\'s a first person game Oh, so not only do we wait for a avatar 2, we wait for an avatar game? Let me guess wont release till 2033?(I know it says coming 2022, but lets face it. Will they?) If this has online multiplayer Na´vi vs. Humans Stars Wars Battlefront style Deathmatch, then I am all in for it ...I honestly thought everyone nowadays would\'ve forgotten about avatar. But I stand corrected. I hope you can switch from 1st to 3rd person while on your mount Ahhhhhhhhh this is gonna be awesome So is this game going to come out before or after Avatar 2? Because if it’s after, I’ll see y’all in 10 years Jest zapotrzebowanie na GRĘ przyczyniającą się do zmniejszenia HANDLU DZIEĆMI  Pozdrawiam I wonder how many people are rewatching Avatar because of this trailer, i just did. I hope we can play as humans as well Dropping last gen consoles! Finally a game that does so the game will be full next gen! THUMBS UP! even the best graphics card in 2021 cant compare to the 2009 movie  Mesmerizing ️️️ This game reminds me of the game Turok (2008 release). God I hope I can play as the humans Wowwwwwww After this Trailer i Watching the movies again  please tell me we\'re gonna see Pandora\'s biomes that aren\'t the Jungle or Mountains\n\ni.e. Deserts, Oceans, Great Plains, Coniferous Forests, or maybe the Polar Regions For a next gen Ubisoft game, the game looks pretty last gen for a Ubisoft game. I hope that its not build with the Ubisoft-Rules.\nThe Movie is one of my favorites, I really hope the game will be too. I want a game of thrones game next You get an Avatar body double in the package. Hmm this games have potential please make it happen Day one! I don’t care what it actually looks like I love avatar Only thing that worries me is its a ubisoft game. I dont want no AC open bland world bullshit. Other than that its looks amazing I decent effort to make us actually care about Avatar again before the sequel. I really hope they add it to ps4 because not everyone has a ps5 Kinda hope u also get to play as the humans not gonna lie wow i am waiting this move Looks like in-engine footage touched up and pre-rendered for demonstration purposes. Looking forward to the actual consumer product just to see what 9th Gen foliage actually looks like (I love dense video game forests). The cheat code for this game will be the Navi stalling until the US abandons the planet and leaves all their military hardware for your blue tribe. Funny how this is coming out faster than Avatar 2 So, will you be able to select which side you fight for like in the last Avatar game? I always thought why do humans / army men keep destroying any wonderland like monsters. Aren\'t humans nature lovers  Iam waiting for avatar part 2 Reminds me a lot of Horizon Zero Dawn, which is a good thing. Whaaat... Great graphics If they let you pick your banshee from like a whole flock of them, color, stats, size, that would be awesome to me I hope you can play as the humans as well Is it a bit weird that they\'re announcing a new Avatar game now? There were rumours that the second movie was gonna come out next year. The graphics look insane but this is ubisoft. I won\'t be suprised if it turns out about killing enemy base camps, skinning animals and freeing radio tower or something else boring. \n\nPlease ubisoft can we get meaningful side quests like those of \'ghost of tsushima\' or \'god of war\' , atleast try to tell a short narrative through the side quests, try to weave a story for once. Cool, another Game I can\'t play. I was so Hyped because I thought it\'s the Trailer for the second movie beautiful animation I didn\'t know that we needed another avatar game until i saw the trailer Is this like a remake of the PS3 game published by Ubisoft long ago, or a direct sequel? I hope we’ll be able to pick sides like the PS3 game. Being able to be a avatar or work with the militia people. \n\nEdit: For those who don’t know the PS3 game is literally called Avatar: The Game. I highly suggest you pick it up, very fun. Learned my lesson with cyberpunk from now on I wait until its out and gameplay is available before buying cause companies seem to be sloppy with games nowadays 1:13 amazing wait you cant play as the humans?\nthats a big miss there buddy\nI honestly would get the game if you could play as the humans, but this is just a hard pass I need this to be good. Just be good plz. Remember kids: It\'s Ubisoft, and what does it mean? No trust and no pre-orders. this one should have waited for VR the game has insane graphics, then the helicopters appeared... those explosions and bullets look like they belong back in PS2 아바타2 기다리고 있어요 \n코로나19 걸려 죽어도 좋으니\n아바타2 는 꼭 영화관 에서 볼거에요!!! Woah. They really upped draenei starting area campaign this time So its being made by ubisoft which means it will have around 60 missions but in reality there will be only 3 missions 20 times each. i am hoping for a kickass soundtraxk This might be one of the sequels  I just got hit with big dose of ""How young was I when I played the first one?"" I love unisoft and Ubisoft games too and this avatar game too but they should make it third person I think we\'ve reached the point where the in-game graphics will probably have surpassed the CGI that was in the actual movie. i want to play as the marines wiping out the natives You need RTX GPU to play this game   Almost got excited. Then I noticed it’s ubisoft But than, everything changed when the fire nation attacked...\n\nWait, wrong Avatar. This new panzer Dragoon looks nice TORUK MAKTO!!! \n\nI know this is not the actual game. But I want it to be good. I still like Avatar. :) Game of my childhood will be Remade?  I have no word... Please launch in android mobile with high graphics. ️ Wow those trained soldiers really be having that stormtrooper aim Bgm is awesome ️ I remember when they announced they was making it years ago, gald to see it finally This looks kind of like what a fish does outside of water. Can\'t wait to clearing enemy outposts again I want this game on the nintendo Switch Please make it 3rd person game please please please, in 1st person you will miss so many beautiful things because of the camera angles... Apuesto lo que sea que si lo hubieran hecho en 3era persona  seria mucho mas exitoso I like how we got a AAA Avatar game before Avatar 2, but I\'m bot complaining. This looks amazing. If I can\'t play as the glorious conquering humans, then I\'m not playing. Let me play as the humans and Ill be all for it lol Wow I didn’t think this was real  Now that\'s what you call a... Triple-A game! ba-dum tsss! Waiting 2 Gotta be honest, do be expecting a, ""Shut up and fly straight!"". Everyone is hating on this, but with the massive increases in polygon count that we\'ve seen in the latest Unreal 5 demos and the reflections we can accomplish with Nvidia RTX, I wouldn\'t be surprised if this is pretty close to the final look of the game on a high-end PC. If anything I feel like the Na\'vi could\'ve actually looked a bit better, definitely some uncanny valley stuff going on with their faces. Anyone remember the old avatar game, I remember playing it back in 2010 or so, it was an ok game I just wanted to see if anyone had played it I was excited until I saw it\'s an Ubisoft game I wished for a new game for Avatar... I\'m so disapointed that you only play as a Navi... They are not apealing for me and looks like will be a far cry like game, like primal or the last ghost recons. Just a sandbox open world game with a lot of markers on the map, territories controlled by bosses you have to take down and a resistence you need to build up. What a burned out formula. I hope we get to play as humans I thought this was a first look into the movie. My heart almost stopped. problem is GPU shortage, you might find one but 3-4 times the price that sound and music ... nostalgia 2009... Im so impressed, i’m already not buying the game Keep your expectations lower you will never be disappointed imagine this would be a open world pvp mmorpg :OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Hope the game is good, to compensate for the fact that the charapters do not look like the movie actors...\n\nJust saying! What we see? World of Warcraft : Avatar. For the Horde! sooooooo... do i need to plug my hair ""tsaheylu"" into my PS5 to play this game or just insert a regular game disc? Let me guess, there will be a lot of season passes and other donate options Это же игра, но все равно эпично Wow mind blowing Ubisoft stick to the Wildlands, Zero Dawn, Ghosts of Tsushima, Far Cry system and DO NOT increase enemy health with difficulty. Make their AI more difficult. Cant wait Please don\'t let this be Assassin\'s Creed: Avatar. We don\'t need a another re-skinned AC game. UBISOFT PLEASE LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY AND PUT A 3 PERSON VIEW OPTION!!! AND PLEASE MAKE THE GAME WORTH HIS PRICE!!! I\'VE WAITED 9 YEARS!!! (since i bought the 1 game on ps3) Better be able to have the option of Human or Navi. Guys one question : its FILM? Because the graphics is awesome!!! i\'m calling it; This is just gonna be any other FarCry except it\'s Avatar based I swear if this is going to be an Ac/Watchdogs game with an Avatar skin i will loose it This game reminds my childhood Wasn’t their an avatar game made before? Or was it just a fever dream I had This trailer is so satisfying... I hope you can create your own character Kinda scared because this is Ubisoft we are talking... There\'s definitely gonna be a graphic downgrade  Hope its something like Horizon Zero Dawn. If this is basically Ark Survival Evolved but Avatar then I\'ll be happy. Iam so excited I can\'t wait to climb up a really high place to reveal a portion of the map, approximately 16 times. The numerous quests to fetch 10 animals turds or some kind of flower will also be enjoyable. seeing trailers as good looking as this one is just sad nowadays, knowing ubisoft it\'s gonna be an empty shell of a game. such a shame Still confused how bow and arrow on a flying bird has a chance against an intergalactic civilization that SHOULD have AI aiming systems for their guns. Its a game: Happy\n\nLooks good : HAPPIER\n\nMade by ubisoft: Panic Me thinking I\'ll be able to play this at a stable framerate: \n\nMy 2-year-old Geforce GTX 1650: ️️️️ Everyone else: pretty flora!\n\nMe: B I G  M E C H It scares me that I couldn’t tell if it was a movie or a video game at first Спасибо за разбор:)))) Unless they can make the journey experience as good as Wildlands. i wonder if you can play as humans, i mean who doesnt want to control one of those mechas? wow, mong chờ từ rất lâu rồi ^^ Ubisoft Please release this game on the PS4 Pro if possible thanks! this better be more like it\'s own thing, rather than an assassin\'s creed clone Oobisoft Im so glad I got my RTX ready... Aw when this was revealed on E3 I screamed, can’t wait Wonder if I can play as the RDA in this one like the last game. \n\nThat is if I even want to buy a ubisoft game anymore. So is this going to be legit what Anthem wanted to be, or what? Everyone Your gonna need the new gen consoles to play this if you don\'t already have one. Please tell Mr they made this for the Oculus quest! El juego se podra jugar en tercera persona o solo estara en pri.era persona ? Excited to play it! Also, real ones remember James Cameron’s Avatar: The Game (2009). 2:09 this ikran just hammering a steel attack helicopter with its body is just unexplainably funny to me Can this come to the Nintendo switch too, that\'d be awesome!  I wonder if this will foreshadow anything about the second movie. Remember, it\'s just cinematic, it\'s NOT actual gameplay. I wish it was rockstar making it instead cause then you know it\'s going to be good and not just a cash grab (assassin creed animals still look crappy af) but I\'m still a bit excited Let’s all pray they make this decent. And let’s also pray for usable mechs  I will always be on the side fighting to protect nature no matter what planet there on rockstar can make this game awesome full of fun ..... Avatar 2 ehdottomasti 3D sekä muutkin Avatar elokuvat, koska 3D antaa niin paljon enemmän kuin 2D sekä kun julkaistaa Blu ray niin silloinkin mukaan ehdottomasti 3D versio. Ihmettelen suuresti, että miksi 3D on out kun sen pitäisi olla in..... Haloooooo Avatar tuottajat ja ohjaajat, ehdottomasti elokuvateattereihin Avatar 2 ja muutkin jatko-osat 3D versioina sekä myynti Blu ray versiot mukaan 3D versio vaikka sitten hieman isommalla myyntihinnalla..... 3D is in and cooooooooool.  Клёво смотрится .... Ждем, ждём ... Thought this was the movie trailer, this if fine too let’s gooooo Музыкальное сопровождение Avatar и   ArcheAge очень похожи So far it looks like a mix of Ark survival evolved,    Horizon zero dawn, and a little of alien vs predator 2010, and I’m loving it The most important question is... can you play as a humans? Can\'t wait for a game vs film graphics comparison lmao. Будто не фильм а компьютерная игра. Так долго тянули со временем. Обещали брмбический фильм seeing trailers as good looking as this one is just sad nowadays, knowing ubisoft it\'s gonna be an empty shell of a game. such a shame Hopefully we’re able to play humanity in a this. Death to the blue skins I can see this being so cool if it’s like a horizons breaking dawn kinda concept Considering this is Ubisoft game ...end product is going to look more like Tetris than what you see in this trailer. I love how the comments are roasting ubisoft. It\'s funny, but in a sad, frustrating kind of way. hmmm could be interesting.  I hope it is in the mold of Horizon Zero Dawn. Another war video game. sadly the exploration side is left aside. Avatar has a lot of potentials, this game should be  a mix of RPG and exploration I need to buy a PC The only remotely exciting thing that Ubisoft announced today This Project looks big and\nAmbitious like Starfield , Star Citizen and since Cyberpunk 2077. UBISOFT!!!!!!!!!!! Do you really think I forgot about The Division or MadDogs or Assassin Creed or Ghost Recon Breaking Point or NM.\n I\'ll just sit back and watch this one. I\'m sure there will be a microtransaction system or pay-to-win feature added for sure. Plzz come fast I\'m waiting  My only request is make 3rd Person view a option I will wait as long as it takes, it looks beautiful, has a great concept, and you guys have a whole year! \nSincerely yours, a Regular Gamer  60% of all gamers are too young to understand what this is This is insaaaane  YYYYYEEEEEEESSSSSSS!!!! FINALLY! I’ve waited too long for this. why they do a solo game, they ain\'t no more good for it, they may\'ve done a multiplayer hugh map scale Na\'vi against humans and it would\'ve been pretty cool Ps5 controller on this should be amazing The movie will be coming out around when the game releases as well then to hype it all up the same as what ark did, they released ark when Jurassic world came out Welcome to the new series of "" Can\'t offer but still watching "" Avatar mind-blowing flim Who else has always wanted to go to Pandora So I\'ll start the pool. 5 game breaking bugs that make the game absolutely uncompletable on launch day. All will not be corrected for at least a month. Ubisoft will not even acknowledge at least one for at least 3 weeks despite videos being posted showing it on YT. ️ You have reached the maximum trailers to watch: please pay 3.99 to see another trailer I’m really not liking the fact that you can’t play as the humans in this game. What if you just want to colonize pandora?? Is Avatar still a thing? isnt this like 10 years late at the party? I just really hope it doesn\'t have a RPG element like their other recent titles. If not then I\'m all for it Excellent ️️️️️️ I\'m damn sure final version of the game would be very downgraded awesome This is so beautiful. But this movie is just an animation,  not gameplay! Awww…wished it was 3rd person  Probably the only good reveal to come from ubisoft forward.. Interesting animation seems like a enjoyable game to play. We saw it for the 1st time back in 2009, it\'s been 12 years, we are still waiting... Waiting from kerala ️ ждем с нетерпением Temper your expectations, people. Ubisoft Massive studio has produced some serious blunders in the past. Their Snowdrop engine is all eye candy and no substance, wrought with technical issues. Don\'t hype this up too much I hope there will be an opportunity to play for humans. If not, it will be very sad. Legit thought this was the sequel Dam! I literally searched Avatar randomly and found this masterpieces realised 17 hrs ago Lets hope its not unoptimized like the first avatar game So do we get to play as the good guys or do we have to play as the smurf monkey people? Is it just me or the trailer looks kinda cartoony? Remember soldier, never trust a cinematic trailer. Hope I can play as the humans, I love cutting down trees. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a first person , action-adventure game.\n\nI don\'t know how to feel about this. стелами против вердалёта? ну, круто! для шнурков самое то! Well, I\'ll prepare myself for disappointment, cuz it\'s a Ubisoft game, and the track record so far isn\'t great, to say it lightly. There\'s always something missing, or that could have used more fleshing out, and I doubt this will be any different. Guess it\'s not worth it to do the last 20%, when the easier 80% gets you ""enough"" sales already. I\'d love to be proven wrong, but I doubt I will be, for some reason. aaaand its Ego-Perspective..... so I am out.... i was sooo looking forward to this game. Was one of my most wanted, cuz i dreamed about a great Avatar Game since the movie and now hope is gone... Whyyy whyyy everyone like stupid ego perspective and ruin so much good games with it... i wished ego perspective never existed..... Trailer looks wonderful but I still have trust issues after Anthem littetly it\'s just a game!?  I hope we get the option of choosing who we are in the game... I want to be a soldier and fire missiles at those darn blue things! They are good in showcasing next generation graphic trailers. But the real game will be something totally opposite. Its been years since I was hyped for a game.\n\nIronic since so many people disliked the movie and also the franchise i guess. I wish it was 3rd person rpg. I can’t play F person games  I quess the play style will be something between Horizon zero dawn and assassins creed. I can\'t Wait to see some gameplays Legend  it is not easy to be a gamer in 3rd world country. hmmmm hope some day i can play this game  AAAAaaaaamazing I hope in this game, playing as humanity, I can make my Stellaris humanity proud No se compara con la belleza de la Tierra Hope you can play as a human and blow up the overgrown smurfs! I would like to play it on windows XP I\'m confused is this game first person or 3rd person. Personally I think it should be 3rd person. is this going to be open world game ? IVE LITERALY PLAYED THE FIRST GAME FOR 10 YEARS PREPARING FOR THISSSSSS Knowing Ubisoft the game will be nothing like the trailer . Let’s see if Ubisoft proves us wrong . Yours sincerely ️  damnit why did ubisoft have to make this any other non pay to win company could have made this my only hope for this game is if it is single or co-op that it has no pay to win features Anyone remembers the old PS3 Avatar game? Lets just say I shot both the general and the avatar professor and finished both storylines xD. wow!!! I\'m gonna ""tsaheylu"" the f*** into this game when it gets released. Man I hole you can be the bad guys in this game. If this comes out before Avatar 2 does, I\'m going to laugh Ya quiero ver a los #ARKEANOS jugar esta joyita I love this Universe, but with Ubisofts new policy that you must agree to surrender your ""Right of Withdrawl"" in other words your right to a refund AFTER you have paid for it and BEFORE you can download it; is just unfair and illegal. They have no right to ask Customers to surrender their legal rights! Please god please let this happen This script inspired by Great Ramayan Epic️ So this is not a movie and whole time thinking that this is a movie  0:58\nBeatiful nature: *exists*\nA random beast: *M E G A F A R T* Can you play as RDA (humans) in the new game? So nothings really changed, entire squads go out to kill one blue person annddd no ones been nuked from orbit yet. Eh without a new engaging story it won\'t matter how good it looks, if it looks like that in the final product anyway. This trailer reminds me of #Horizon Forbidden West if this game doesn\'t let you pick sides i\'ma be mad I hope this runs on my Gtx 1650. I hope it\'s actually an open world unlike the last attempt, James Cameron\'s Avatar: The Game. All the middle pairs of legs look like they were animated as an afterthought. They\'re just walking like four legged animals. Everything else looks so good it sticks out horribly. I have bought a Lenovo gaming laptop. I will use it for school, music and playing games that do not come to PS4 like this one. I preferred to go for a gaming laptop as my old was crashing with music softwares. So I can keep my old PS4 for those games that still come there and when there is a new gen exclusive, i can definitely get it on PC. Se ve muy bien this better be a good game  Flight of passage is what got me into avatar\n\nAs the Navi say during this important rite of passage: sivako  - rise to the challenge Good luck Прикольно! Edit: Holy cow, thanks everyone for the 1.3k likes!\n\nI still cant believe that the original Avatar was made in 2009. The visuals look like they were made in the far far future! Which I love! I\'m still waiting since 2009. Every year I\'m looking for the new film and now finally it\'s coming...so happy 🥳, love it 😍🥰 A guy literally ditched his body to smash an alien princess This movie is the first movie ever to be on a budget of 1 billion. Avatar 2 is like the corona-virus. They are moving the goal-posts every time. Just one more year guys. I\'ve been waiting for this for so long. I can not wait to see it. Fingers crossed with no more lock downs we can watch this in the cinema Hope the movies open up by this time and we can all see this together.. by the way James Cameron is bringing 3D without glasses for the Avatar 2. I can’t wait yessssss one of my favorite movies part 2 gone be so lit 🔥 The movie that i will never forget... I\'m so excited for the movie 2, i can\'t wait more Avatar isn\'t just my favorite movie. Its my whole child hood. This will be the best series since lord of the rings! Me llega por recomendación pero estoy ansioso ver la segunda parte de cómo será la siguiente historia. Excellent work very excited about this sequel!!! Less than a year away now!! I\'m so excited! God I hope they don\'t extend the release date another 10 years😅 Avatar by far my favorite extra terrestrial movie! I especially love the bianchi\'s and the thantor Good job! I look forward to the next Avatar movie! Great job! Love the tone a lot, works really well I’m sitting watching avatar on my curved big ass led tv it looks absolutely amazing and insane how it still seems like a new movie Avatar just reminds me of Halo when I first saw it. First you got the air ships that look like hornets for Halo 3, then you got the birds which are (PURPLE and called BANSHEES) the similarities are there but such a good movie still chose the right characters as well. Imagine the vibe watching this at the movie theatres can\'t wait to see this Can’t wait ❤️ Sounds good cant wait to watch I feel like the movie will start with Grace saying...Pandora... then cuts to Jake riding a Banchey thru the trees of Pandora, then Grace says \'\'a world unimaginable to take in\'\' then Jake finally lands on a cliff to see Natr\'i waiting and has her hands covering her mouth in excitment, Jake asks what she is hiding from him in a tone of laughter then she calms her self down and says \'\'Jake... I\'m going to have a baby\'\'. No one \'fires\' a bow like that one does. He\'s got his hand backwards! Since it’s taking so long I’m guessing this CGI must be absolutely insane then. For it take take such years. This announced this so long ago and now finally it’s almost time Can\'t wait for the actual trailer When avatar came out in 2009 i was  years old , and i was watchin it with my family when i was like 5 years old . I was sad that there was no continuation . Now i am happy , i know that Avatar 2 won\'t be the last . They are planning to do 3 more avatars ,and it won\'t take over a decade . Avatar 2 should be out in 2022 , Avatar 3 should be out in 2024 ,avatar 4 should be out in 2025. Liked it but you could\'ve done much better like adding some scenes from Aquaman or the meg.Also,according to Jim Cameron the live action or principle photography of Avatar 2 is 100% complete and only post production is left.Not only that but live action parts of Avatar 3 is almost 95% complete and they\'ll start remaining work as immediately after Avatar 2 is released. Finally something new from one of the best directors James Cameron Eu assisti o avatar 1 em 3d foi muito louco I so can\'t wait for this. Been a long time coming The shooting of Avatar 2 is complete and the shooting of Avatar 3 is 95% complete as reported by James Cameron\'s Source. Director: ""A new world where the strong prey on the weak"" \nAlso Director: Proceeds to forget entire first film Anybody else realize that avatar is the story of pocahontas..on their own with out being told? You\'d be surprised how many people react with awe... I\'m waiting and I\'m so excited about  avtar 2 Nicely done even though it\'s not real.\nAll the best 👍\nDo more videos like this\n❤️❤️❤️ From india 🇮🇳 Wow its looks stunning top demais esse filme I thought this was a trailer for a avatar game in the new ps5 ... my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined I actually thought it was the trailer then 🤦\u200d♂️😂 So was that the same ship as in prometheus? Looking forward to Alien v Avatar ;-) Question: Can avatar 2 beat endgame at the boxoffice? Great job! Great effort !!Good Job👍💯👏👏👏👏 I’m pretty sure how it’s going end. “ aliens will win” I’ll be shocked if not. This is gonna be a Sci-Fi Trail of Tears isn\'t it? Who is hyped. The movies will be AWESOME So far the only movie I\'ve seen where the bad guys win. Awww and they made such a good thumbnail He Went In For This One. Inevitable ----this word just hits differently I\'ve been whating since I was 4 years old for this movie I need it 🤩🤩👌🏻🥳🤩🤩 Yeahh .. AVATAR 2!! 🤩🤩🥰🤩 XOXO PERÚ 🥰🇵🇪❤️🤜🏻🤛🏻 Lmao I love clicking these to see what they do with it aha This second one better be good or ima be mad it better be better than the first There are quite a few things I wouldn\'t do for my family.\nI wouldn\'t become a serial killer, I wouldn\'t hurt puppies, I wouldn\'t cut off an arm, I wouldn\'t binge watch The View, I wouldn\'t streak down main street, I wouldn\'t punch Mike Tyson in the nose and I imagine I won\'t watch this movie. :p 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Avatar 2 ,,,, ye naam hi kafi hain ? Pure duniya me record banane ke liye🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\nI am supper excited🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺 Wasn\'t really a massive fan of the first one but this looks good Not sure about the casting decisions, I guess James Cameron wanted a familiar crew he could work with. As for this kool-aid nonsense, kate should save it for the analyst, and be humble.\n\nThere\'s a day coming when we\'ll all need to be humble. An I don\'t mean eating pie. Well i guess 90% of the trailer is scenes from the original movie. I love the trailer and I understand it took some time to make. So good job! I guess... One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates⭕️Non-Duality Finally another Avatar SO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music  worldwide}\n\n......AWESOME.....!!!!!! I\'m waiting for the meme where the ""It\'s inevitable"" get covered by Pewdiepie saying, ""inevigable, injevitable, inevigitable, INGEVIJTABLE!"" 🤣 This isn\'t real but I can\'t wait for it it has been to long What is called a family 😄\nTrying to love urself I hope avatar 2 will be a good movie HOPE ✝️ , Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!!

I like this movie 😘 FINALLY LETS GO Those anyone know the name of the epic soundtrack at the end ?? I just had the idea of a avatar game wouldn’t that be awesome. Maybe it will come A\'la navi!! ✊ My favourite movie . i am waiting to see these movie Yet there’s no clips of part two on this trailer only a voiceover on clips from the movie in 2009 I’m really disappointed that they haven’t released the movie yet smh 🤦\u200d♀️ THE BABYYYYYY ITS ADORABLE Ya quisieran que hubiera otra!!\nEstan desesperados .. Please let it be a great movie like the first one not some pc garbage 🙏 Movie with 2050\'s reality graphics Prometheus scenes makes it nice!!!! I am sorry not that this movie is great and a second one would be amazing I was thinking this was the last bender movie haha there were scenes from the movies star trek AND prometheus in this “teaser trailer,” not an actual teaser Dont you just love it when its not even the movie :l That\'s Really Great, BUT Most of Those Clips are from The 1st Avatar Dec 2021 cant come soon enough!!!! Ion think it’s real if it was they would b showing only clips from the first movie and a couple different if it was new wouldn’t it show hella parts from avatar 2 it was mostly avatar 1 so idk if it’s real James Cameron is unique Only king kong 2005 and avatar can conpete with visuals in todays movies. I mean these movies were beautifull, and on the side note, these are the only movies that were so good that there was no need to look at my phone or skip like i do ussualy in other movies and these kind of movies make me want not just a sequel but to live my whole life in them. Not sequel, not tv show, whole life. Now thats a good movie if you ask me. I watched both avatar and king kong so many times but i never skip one second of them or look away from the screen while watching them. At this point I don\'t think they gonna realize avatar 2 they been saying they will since 2019 come on nw it\'s 2021 1:05 is that a shot from star trek? lol i couldn’t keep it to myself At first I thought this was a real teaser but u took clips from other movies but it’s not bad they need to hire u Wow😯💯 I’m sorry everyone but I didn’t like the first but I’m willing to see the second and have it change my mind Gotta love the prometheus clip in there😂 that\'s just desperate Avatar 2 yay Been to long coming!!!!!!!!! Wow Mr.Cameron director of Titanic And Terminator and Terminator Judgement day made this 😎 im guessing their gonna release avatar 3 in the year 2026 Jajaja el que no se vio la  primera pensara  que de verdad  esta es la segunda Is this an actual trailer or just something someone had thrown together? They smash whenever they connect they tails right? So that means he smashed the horses and birds? 1:20\nBro that fire scene is literally from guardians of the galaxy XD Wait this movie is getting a sequel? When is in theaters They really combined the scenes from Avatar 1 and the movie Riddick💀 Wtf?? People actually believe this is real trailer?? 😂 Avatar😍 Will you be seeing the child of Jake Sully and his mate Wait please tell me,is this the real traileer or something else? Pretty sure that’s benedict cumberbatch in Star Trek 🤔 Hopefully the humans win this time 0:49 This scene it\'s from prometheus landing scene The only reason why I\'m considering seeing avatar 2,is because kate winslet is in it Vaovv etkilendim 🤯 im confused are some of these clips from the original avatar and prometheus? Avatar 2 yay 2021 Arnold Schwarzenegger memes coming soon: “And the Oscar goes to AVIDAH ABBIDAH AVATAH” 11yrs in the making You guys do realize that this story is actually the story of what has happened to Native Americans. You do know this is not the real trailer Ava2r: Avatar 2 lookin good Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow... The Dark Side is strong with this idea. this cannt be the trailer for avatar 2 because at minute 01:05 was the beginning of star trek into darkness Weighing for you avatar2👀 Dude it’s the same as 2009 there’s like nothing in the trailer we haven’t seen this is basically the original movie And alot of scenes from the first movie you photoshoped a baby, take some scene from the dysneyworld pandora themeworld and some scenes from the 1st film, god job😂 Bro I\'m still waiting I was every since 2015 Wish this was real So avatar 1 with some extra other movie parts becomes a avatar 2 lol you thought we were trolling with avatar and alien prometheus and another movie.

Soundtrack: 10/10\nAnimation : 11/10\nCharacters: 10/10\nPlot: 10/10 I don\'t know how to explain but unlike the two reboots of Spider Man, \n          see this movie it was actually like seeing Spider Man for the first time again ... Let\'s be real, none of us thought the movie would be this good You know what would be crazy, if they actually make a real multiverse movie with Toby McGuire, Andrew Harfield, and Tom Holland 👀👀👀👀 I can\'t believe this came out almost 3 years ago! This is by far my favorite movie ever. It\'s animation style, soundtrack, plot, and characters are all top notch. Can\'t wait for Spiderverse 2! digging the animation This movie just made history by winning an Oscar for best Animated Feature Film at the Oscars of 2019! Congratulations Sony and anyone who work on the project 😊👍 No word of a lie, this movie had me crying a few times. This might be the best Spiderman film ever made. I have never before seen Spiderman so high and so low, so young and so old.\nI was LIT with the spirit of Spidey the entire way. I LOVE this movie because it says with all it\'s heart that ANYONE can be Spiderman.  Plus it was hilarious, had excellent action scenes, jaw-dropping animation, and standard-busting characterization. To record, this is my favorite Spiderman film that I have ever seen.   When someone said this movie was bad, \n""This fry is your opinion, its soggy, weird, gross. But this delicious normal fry, is my opinion."" No Way Home looks amazing\nBut I don\'t think this masterpiece can ever be topped This movie is really good because, The Exaggerated Swagger of a Black Teen This movie was an experience. I thought cinema was getting repetitive until this came out Yes, filmmaking is a business, and everyone\'s in it for profit. But sometimes something comes along, and it\'s just a beautiful gift to the world, treasured by everyone. The movie is MUCH better than the trailer. Oh my fucking god it\'s amazing. "" What makes you different, is what makes YOU Spider-Man "" They went all out with this one, the art style, the characters, the story, the action, the soundtrack, this movie was an experience the first time watching it, I hope a sequel comes out for it sometime soon Can\'t believe it been almost 2 years since we got this Masterpiece <3 Oh wow, they are really going there ... “What makes you different....\nIs what makes you SPIDERMAN “ \n\n- Peter B Parker This animation style is truly something else; who ever made this is truly talented, honestly, and I love they’re showing there is “different” spidermen... I was waiting for that ! I just watched this movie after my friends harassing me to watch it. I don\'t regret it. Truly the best thing I\'ve watched in years. I love the art and just everything. Remember when the trailer dropped and everyone was like ""it\'s gonna be the best Spider-Man movie of all time"" AND THEN IT REALLY WAS. This movie is such an amazing movie. I am glad it won the Oscar. I was not able to get out of the movie for a  while. I literally can feel those emotions. \nI loved this movie ❤ This movie deserved to win Best Animated Feature. I like the animation. The combination of CGI and handmade animation is a great idea. I\'m glad to see something different than typical Pixar-CGI. It would be cool if Disney made a film with a similar technique. Let this be the new trend! Wow this movie looks super good IT WON THE OSCAR!!! This movie totally deserved it, it’s so amazing. <3 Came back from watching Far from Home. Spider-Verse still remains as the superior Spiderman film. Soundtrack: 11/10\nCharacters: 10/10 \nStory: 10/10 \nAnimation 11/10  This movie was one hell of an experience. \nLoved it.❤️ Did anyone else get chills when Peter said “But this isn’t about me, not anymore” Spider Pig! Spider Pig!\nDoes whatever a spider pig does!\nCan he swing from a web? No he can\'t\nHe\'s a pig Lookout! Wow, I just got done watching this movie with my daughter...\n\nAnd we both loved it! 💖 10/10 movie, probably watched it 10 to 20 times and never gets old it also has one of the best soundtrack for a movie. The animation is unique and beautiful, the story is a solid 9/10 but it has a good message which is that you can be your own spider-man/spider-women 😁 This movie is definitely a masterpiece Just watched the movie, and I can happily say that this is a masterpiece of an animated movie 🎥👏🏽 Anyone else come back after the trailer for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse? I love how they paid homage to Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man. Congratulations Sony on the Oscar win, it was very well deserved!!! I love how each character has a different animation style. You can really see it in Pen and Spider ham. It really gives the movie a comic book vibe and shows the different dimensions. it\'s a very unique idea Just finished watching the movie. So amazing. The humor, the plot, the characters, the dialogue. Everything is so brilliantly made. \n\n10/10 indeed This is one of the best ever animated films I\'ve ever seen. It\'s visually stunning, powerful, heartwarming and just amazing. The soundtrack is incredible too! Who came here after the sequel was announced?? ""What makes you different is what makes you Spider-Man""\n\nBefore the movie was released a lot of people, myself included, didn\'t fully understand or appreciate this line. Now after watching the movie it makes sense. I love this movie so much! Awesome story, beautiful emotions and really cool animation! Made me cry, made me laugh, Good feeling. Definitely the best Spider-Man movie to date. The other Spidey movies felt like adaptions of the comics, this felt like a love letter to them The varied animations and art styles in the different universes are just amazing! And I love how they done just try for the most realistic style of animation they can, but kept some comic-book styled things 3 years later after watching this movie countless times, I still get hyped after watching the trailer I\'m so in love with this!....  Can\'t stop playing the soundtracks especially sunflower 😍 😍 This movie made me feel like the first time I watched the first Tobey\'s Spider-man movie when I was a kid.  And I came out of the theater with tears of joy.  it\'s just so good This was probably the best superhero movie. It\'s so damn good in every aspect. Casting, soundtrack, art style(s), animation and a relatively beautiful and complex plot. I was blown away by how good Spider-Man Homecoming was, but this is something above that. The fact that we get homecoming, then we get this... is a blessing After 2 years of its release and watched the movies multiple times I just love this trailer. Let’s face it. They hid the real plot really really well. Many movies just spoils everything here they did just an amazing job keep it up Sony! I really like how they trick you into thinking Miles is already Spider-Man in this universe with this trailer. They even had Jake Johnson dub some of Chris Pine\'s Spider-Man\'s line just for the trailer. So going into the movie, you still don\'t entirely know what\'s going to happen. 10/10 This movie has my heart omg it makes me so emotional like idk how to explain it 😩. It deserved to win an Oscar ❤️💕 100/10 🤤💕 Just came out of seeing it. This is a game changer, the amount of passion and effort put in every frame is unparalleled. Can\'t wait to see it again. This movie is hands down the best Spider-Man movie in any format The animation style is just spectacular This movie is a masterpiece 10/10 animation 10 out of 10 voice acting this movie is the best spider man movie since spider man 2 Spider-Man: Into the SpiderVerse is arguably the best spiderman movie ever...animated or not. I just left from seeing it and I liked everything about it from the animation to characters and story...My only regret is not seeing it in 3D, I feel like it was made for 3D; at times there were blurry images associated with the 3D effect. And be sure to stay for the post credits...its very funny. I watched this today and I was blown away and the fact it was comic book style made it even better I give this a solid 10/10 I\'m going to watch this a few more times I have no words to describe this movie, it is just epic! The best animated movie ever right there along with Ghost In The Shell and Final Fantasy The Spirits Within. you can feel the love for art and animation through the screen, in every detail. I’m kind of sad this song wasn’t used in the movie.  It fits so well, specifically at 1:52 to the end.  It’s just so good I randomly walked into a theatre yesterday and decided to watch this film - I hadn\'t seen any trailers, and really had no idea what the movie was about other than Spider-Man wearing Air Jordans. Seeing this trailer almost makes me sad because it truly doesn\'t do the final product justice. What an incredible piece of art. Acabei de ver no cinema ! Muito bom ! Achei bem diferente do  estilo de animação que costumamos ver ! This movie was awsome! They did a great job with creating the reality! The music engineers did an awsome job putting those vibrations with each character! This movie blew me away an took me on a ride its fun! The people who disliked were enjoying the trailer so much they clicked it on accident went and saw this movie the other day it was amazing it was like a comic book that came to life and it was a peace off art will pay to see this movie again it was awesome rest in peace stan lee 2017: The Emoji Movie becomes one of the worst animated movies ever!\n2018: The same studio gives us a brilliant film that gets an oscar for best animated feature. If they dont somehow incorporate that meme with 2 spidermans pointing at each other this movie is a bust. One of the best films ever made. Absolutely ground-breakingly brilliant in every way. Best Spiderman film to date. In so many aspects, this movie ascends expectations. If you\'re not into Spiderman then go watch this wonderful masterpiece of animation. 🤘🕷️ I cannot praise this movie enough it\'s fantastic Loved this movie can wait for the sequel That Tobey Maguire imitation was freakin hilarious 💯🔥😂 the funniest thing about John Mulaney playing Peter Porker is that he isn’t putting on a weird cartoon voice for the part. he’s just using his natural speaking voice and delivering jokes like he usually would. This movie was so good !! The message of it was everything! This movie can literally not get any better\nspider-ham is in this movie\nIt CAN get better My favourite parts about this movie are the amazing animation, the spectacular story line, and that not all of the main characters have blue eyes and blond hair. Muito bom mesmo 👏🏽 Both an animation AND comic book masterpiece. Coolest Spider-Man movie ever! Great movie!!! Really beat my expectations! And I’m 24! Really good life lessons and the details are freakin amazing! Story line is perfect!!! Loooove this This is now one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is amazing. The art. The story. Everything so original and refreshing. People. See it! On Blu-ray at minimum! The animation style is simply unique & priceless!!! 👏 I just watched this ... absolutely amazing! One of the best films I\'ve ever seen. Simply brilliant. 👌👏👍 you have to watch this in the cinemas - the quality of the animations, use of music and general story is just so incredible, you have to do it justice! Best movie I’ve ever seen !! Love it ❤️ so inspiring! I’m going to go watch it today, hope I like it 💕\n\nEdit: Loved it. Definitely recommends it for everyone! Not one of the best movies, but an AMAZING movie. Lots of funny scenes, sad scenes, and many more! Hands down,\nthe best Marvel movie so far . The real movie is far beyond your expectation from the trailer. I\'ve watched this movie. It\'s amaaazing. I just took my nine-year-old daughter to see this and we both love the movie equally.  I love a movie that can span generations!  I guess I\'ll force myself to see it again with my nephew now 😉 I got to see this movie today and it was amazing!!!! Absolutely loved it. This is my new favorite Spiderman movie ❤❤❤ This is still my favorite movie and the best cinema experience I\'ve ever had since 2018 Hands down one of the best movies I\'ve ever seen I remember seeing this and hating that the animation looked ""choppy"".\n\nNow I\'m willing to kill someone if the sequel doesn\'t look exactly the same The animation looks unique and way more interesting than what Sony usually does. So excited to see Miles Morales and Spider Gwen In a feature film!! Been hoping forever to see Miles Morales on screen! SO GOOD. Great message. And I love the animation style. This movie is my favorite movie of 2018 and a must-see I love that the art styles match with their respective Spider-Man:\n1. Peter and Miles = Traditional comic style\n2. Spider-Gwen = Neon colors like in an 80\'s music video\n3. Noir = Noir... Duh I watched this movie twice in theaters. The first time with my sister, and the second time with my mother and my younger siblings. What an amazing and spectacular superhero film. PLEASE WIN THE OSCAR! I didn’t see this movie nor Aquaman at the theater...I just rented them through Redbox a couple of days ago and watched both movies. Aquaman was a 7-10. Spider-Verse was a 10-10, simply incredible. I just watched it today together with my father. He was amazed, laughing, and focused while watching it earlier. This movie is a bomb! 😍👌Especially the music. 🎧🎶 The second one is gonna be amazing!!!!! I’m here cause of the sequel this is one of my favorite movies ❤️🖤💙🕷 ""Hey guys!""\n""Who\'re you?""\n""I\'m Gwen Stacy-""\nPeter immediately starts sobbing Pure genius. Best film, of any genre, I\'ve seen in years. Yeah just ignore the fact that gwen landed on the tree with her toes \n\nSLAY GIRL SLAY. Sony: let’s rate this a PG\nEveryone who’s watched it: huh Today this masterpiece turns one year old.\nHappy first anniversary to the best Spider-Man movie ever made! this was the first animated movie i watched in theatre and i freaking love it I simply LOVE how Gwen Stacy scenes are portrayed with the same coloring of her personal comic series <3 Absolutely stunning - what a visual work of art! Such an awesome movie I\'m in love with the animation and the story and everything \nHope it wins the Oscar cuz if it doesn\'t I\'m going to EXPLODE \nBtw I already saw it 2 times and who knows? Maybe I\'m going for the third.... Arguably the best comic book movie. The movie gave me chills I loved it soo much! I hope there will be a tv series about the other Spider-Mans or Girl (Gwen) I only just got around seeing this film yesterday.  Why did I wait so damn long it\'s brill love love love it.  \nHope they do a sequel one day soon. To be honest, this was the best movie I have seen in 2018. Not only is the animation style new and fantastic, it also perfectly resembles each of the spider peoples\' comics. The comedy works very well, the action scenes are very well done, the emotional scenes deliver super well, the writing is fantastic, the soundtrack is a bop, and it features one of the most appealing, and comic-accurate Spider-Man movies to date. Yes, I think this is better than Infinity War, better than every single movie this year, and beats out every other Spider-Man movie. Surprised this came from the same studio that made the Emoji Movie. 10/10. Just saw it: REALLY GOOD! Go see it in theatres and with family/friends! Was somewhat skeptical when this first was announced but was completely blown away by what I saw. Just saw it in theaters today, it definitely lives up to the hype. This is easily one of, if not the best Spiderman movie to date, perhaps even one of the best movies of 2018. The turnaround from this studio after the Emoji Movie is like if you went from Rebecca Black’s Friday to Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody. This is proof that Sony Pictures Animation is capable, and just needs to consistently have good writers and directors. I just  watched the movie and it was REALLY REALLY good.\nhonestly another of my favorite movies. I have never seen anything like this before. Absolutely incredible animation. When this movie comes out on Netflix, I\'m watching the heck out of it until it\'s gone! This was one of my favorite movies of the year, and also probably the most comic book-like film adaptation I\'ve seen. saw this in 4k on Netflix last night. it was incredible.  moved right into my top 5 superhero films of all time. Every shot of this movie can be made into your wallpaper. Because every second of it was really beautiful. This was one of the best movies i\'ve ever seen. The animation is fantastic My heart was pumping at the end this animation is better than all MCU movies altogether. Congratulations to everyone who worked on this movie for winning Best Animated Feature at the Golden Globes! Well deserved! Literally the best movie ever to be made in earth. We have Spider-Man. Now we have\nSpider-Man \nSpider-Gwen \nSpider-Noir Love, love, love this movie! This movie is just incredibly great .i love it 😊 💕 What makes you different is what makes you spiderman ❤️ I remember doubting this movie when I seen the first teaser like a year ago. I\'m happy to report this movie made me look like a jackass. A really amazing movie, and one of my favorites of last year. Easily the best Spider-Man movie, along with Homecoming. The most beautiful animation movie I’ve ever seen. Ladies and gentlemen, Spider-Man: into the Spider-verse winner for ""Best animated movie"" of 2018 This was so amazing blew my mind best animation I have ever watched the story was done really well Anybody else really like how the animation looks? It’s like a moving comic book and I love it.\n\nEdit: I’ll admit I’m not even that big a fan of comics but c’mon how are ya not  gonna see it? I’m so happy this won best animated picture at the oscars! Great job Sony! This movie was pretty good, hope they make a sequel with miles perfecting his powers The animation in this is AWESOME This movie was so freaking amazinnnnnng . I wasn’t expecting the beautiful vibe of this movie In a trailer, it “said from the minds(writers) that brought you the LEGO Movie”, not “from the company that brought you the Emoji movie” Spider-Man is everywhere this year and I frickin LOVE IT!!!!!!\nCan’t wait for this!! As a fan of Stan Lee and of spiderman since I was 3, this movie is one of the best spiderman movies out there, I cried when I saw Stan cameo and I\'m sure he was proud of this movie as an artist in the entertainment industry - this has some of the best art I\'ve ever seen. Gonna see it asap. I had a dream a few days ago where they made this an actual movie and I was cast as Gwen, I\'ve never wanted a dream to become reality so much before It\'s so stunning! The animation is epic Me: hopefully this would become a live action movie.\nAfter 3 years: \nMe: Wow, for a past few years this thing become a real live action movie which leaded by tom holland, andrew garfield, hailee steinfield, miles from this cartoon movie and many more as spider mans in spider man multiverse movie. Yey! Wow this movie was an absolute roller-coaster. Every single aspect of this movie, with maybe the exception of the main villain, is top notch. If I\'m being honest, it\'s my favourite superhero film of 2018. It\'s just so emotionally rich. At times you\'ll be laughing, and at others bawling. My favorite thing about this movie though is the message. Movie was absolutely amazing. Animation was incredible. Very entertaining! What a fantastic film. Love you Stan. Love you Steve. The best movie ever made! This is the best spider man movie of all time. In fact I wouldn\'t mind if they did more animated super hero movies like this over live action. It\'s been more than one year and it still\'s my favorite movie Nic Cage as Spider-man Noir?  John Mulaney as Spider-ham?  The more I see of this, the more I like it.  I cannot wait to see this one now. See guys, Sony CAN make good movies. They can\'t just make it on-command. Hopefully they don\'t mess up Spider-Verse 2. The scanner darkly type animation for this film is perfect. The water color style painting aspect is incredible mixes with the stop motion animation sequence. Peter Parker is a fun version of Tony Stark. 10000000000/10\nEveryone should see this masterpiece Seen this twice and loved every minute of it If they will going to make this a live action movie, I hope they will get Toby Maguire as Peter Parker again. It still amazes me that the animated Spider-Man movie is so much better than the 7 live action ones with crazy multimillion dollar budgets and huge stars. It shows you don’t really need a cast full of stars or amazing special effects and CGI, just a great story and some amazingly talented writers. One of the best animated films ever ""Do animals talk in this dimension? Cause I don\'t wanna freak him out"" LOL this seems pretty good I just seen this movie today and I think it was AWESOME it blew me away literally. Miles Morales, this youthful wonder in comic world has illuminated millions such as myself with his moxy and amazing nearness in MCU universe. I am happy to see the spidey family they all look stunning. I appreciate this animated motion picture, never have I paused and watched this film from the beginning have watched it like multiple times at this point. I know the characters very well its greatly portrayed . Mile Morales, Jefferson, Rio, Aaron Davis, Kingpin, prowler, Doc Ock, Gwen, Peter parker, auntie may, penny parker, Spider-man noir OMG the rundown never stops its truly stunning and wonderful. Well done to the production and animation team to pick the ideal cast for the voice overs and it look stunning. The bond with the Father and the child is heart-touching same occurs with my father and me. I really want to see a sequal and progressively about this promising astounding spider-man and other flawless spideys from other universe. Great character development,miles to Spider Man. A nobody to a somebody. Miles is the greatest spider man. Great movie. Directiors,thumbs up to you. great movie, 10/10 the way miles act is soo relatable,  like i\'ve feel that too miles. this movie is truly great I love this movie way to much.\nWatched it in theatres multiple times and stil watching it to this day. ""Do animals talk in this dimension cause i don\'t want to freak him out.""\nThat was glorious!😂 Best film ive seen so far kinda feel sad that it ended hope there is a part 2 Possibly the best animation I have ever seen...No, it is the best animation I have ever seen! Watched it on a 3D tv and it was just phenomenal. My friends call me Spider-Man cause I had this role while one performance. Now, I feel alone, I feel that I\'m different from others and this ""What makes you different, is what makes you Spider-Man"" really helps me so much. Thanks... I have never had a favorite movie before in my LIFE and this.. this by FAR has most certainly become it. This is my favorite movie. I ranted for days after watching it and I had no. NO. criticisms. Art styles, beautiful animation, story progression, comedic timing, character development I COULD GO ON Is it just me or i just like how they animate....... its like a smooth stop motion animation..... Just came here to tell all of you who\'re not sure whether it\'s worth watching the movie: \n\nIt absolutely is. ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" officially won a Golden Globe award! \nWill the film deserve an Oscar as well? So that\'s mean that there will be 6 Stan lee\'s cameos in this ? And This is when An Amazing Movie Was Known. I haven\'t watched this movie, but holy moly this animation is GORGEOUS. This is a GREAT movie 🖤🕸️ This movie it’s amazing💯 they need to make another one✊🏽💯 End credit scene was really funny🤣 People: we don\'t like Sony\'s Spiderman \n\nSony: I\'ll give them so many spidermans that they will at least like one Congratulations Spider-Man enter the spider-verse for best animated feature film award at the Oscars. ❤💙🖤🏆 The best Spider-Man movie ever! Sony, Please make a chapter two..I beg you!\nI love this movie soo much! Congrats on the Oscar! You really deserve it! 1:52 is the part yall were waiting for 😏 I can not say enough good things about this movie..its just good on so many levels, story, voice acting and animation style all so good! Not many movies can get me to say absolutely go see it in IMax but this is one a normal screen will make you feel cheated. Its a must see so treat yourselves. I could watch this more than twice. So amazing. One of the best movies I’ve ever seen This movie was the best and me being a spiderman fan made me love this movie even more This movie is a masterpiece The animationstyle was so beautifull and unique I was constantly amazed by it while watching this movie Ok, so we got Spider-Man, Mile Morales, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham. I love it. Hopefully they make a sequel that would introduce Spider-Man 2099, Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker), Superior Spider-Man, and Silk. This movie is actually really good. Took my son. Didn’t expect to love it As someone who has never really been a fan of super hero movies or watched a Spider-Man movie all the way through, this movie was actually really good! It kept my attention during the fight scenes and it had good story. This movie is definitely for everybody👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 The Incredibles, Megamind, and this are my favorite animated superhero movies! So happy that this movie got an oscar I loved this film so much This is still an amazing movie. Seen the movie. It\'s awesome! 10/10 this animation looks amazing If Marvel had the full right on this movie, they wouldn\'t have showed the other spider men. But overall, this movie is just awesome. Loved the animation, great voice cast and the story was fun :) “They’re starting to come through, and I can’t stop them.” Yeah yeah im late but I just watched this movie yesterday and IT WAS AWESOME! These guys did a good work\n\nIt\'s worth watching this master piece! :D One of the best spiderman movies made over the years after the original version also the tracks are so dope If THis movie doesn\'t get Oscar for best animated feature.. Then I would know for sure the academy is rigged. Wow! This animation! It\'s amazing! 😍👍 Best spiderman movie I have ever watched I\'d give it a million stars This movie was amazing It’s really awesome how they made the alternative universes different types of comics like manga, cartoon, noir I delayed watching this for a long time.  Decided to take the plunge, don\'t know what I was waiting for, it was spectacular. Black Panther: We have launched the greatest Black Superhero movie ever! We have made a masterpiece! Into the Spider-Verse: Hold my goober. This an spectacular film I really do recommend seeing this 100%  RIP STAN LEE Out of all the Spider-Men that I thought was going to be in this movie Spider-Ham was definitely not on my list but I\'m glad he\'s in this movie regardless. This movie was absolutely incredible muito bom mano👏👏👏😆👍❤ ""Anyone can wear the mask"" 2020 be like Sequel needs to have 2099,Superior,Future Foundation,Ben Reilly and Kaine\n\nIn my opinion if Sony went all out in this movie it probably wouldn’t have been as good but now that they’ve introduced the idea of the multiverse these spidey’s would be awesome. I watched it with my grandma and she asked me if the characters were real people or animated because the face details look real Still cant believe that the people who made The Emoji Movie made this masterpiece Movie of the year. Indefinitely 🔥🔥🔥 This movie is EVERYTHING This is the BEST movie in the past century ,I can tell you that much.. This movie is not an ordinary  comic movie, it\'s amazing!! superb movie great direction perfect story very good casting and animation is really good this visuals of this movie are down straight awesome, I hope it gets an award for that Saw this movie today and I cried at least 3 times The animation style is just so good I saw this movie today, it was amazing Even the trailer makes me hyped to see it This might possibly be the best movie I have ever seen!!🤩🤩 The inverted kiss\nThe train stopping\nThe car fly into diner\nYup, I see you there Tobey IT WON THE OSCAR!!!!!!\nSuch an amazing film👍👌 I love how they Incorporated Spider-Man 2 when Tobey Maguire saved the train and stop the car from hitting mj 2:15\nfunniest scene in the entire movie 😂 This should have been Best Picture at the Oscars. Brilliant film This is a very good movie I feel now I very excited to watch it This  is awesome I wish we could have more movies like this.😃😃😃 Literally one of my favourite movies ""Do animals talk in this dimension? Cuz I don\'t wanna freak him out""\nHands down, best line in the trailer 😂 My most favorite movie ever. I could watch this over and over just ranting about the artistic quality I just watched that movie (I know it\'s a bit late) and it\'s wonderful just loved every single part of it except the sad part with uncle Aaron (I\'m not going to spoil it) Glad that i am into this world to see this amazing movie....definitely need a part 2 This was a great movie (Siperman: Into the Spider Verse)! And with a great plot! I wonder why they decided to make it into a cartoon vs going for a real movie production. This could have potentially made $2Billion I seen this for the first time today with my wife, and man I really Enjoyed it. SPIDER-HAM LOOKS SO WONDERFULLY CARTOONY!!! THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE SO KICK ASS!!!\n\nI mean......looks cool. I hope they make the second part!!! I loved this movie! I would love to see Tobey Maguire in the sequel We need a Sequel on this. Im addicted to this movie. Cant get enough  of Miles This trailer just feels so ""Spectacular"" to watch. It kinda ""Astonishing"" how much content this trailer is giving to us. It almost gives a ""Superior"" feeling compared to the last trailer. The trailer itself is just so ""Super"" to watch that I just want to watch it over and over. I can\'t wait for the Movie to come out in Christmas cause I can already tell that this going to be ""Amazing"" for our Friendly-Neighbourhood Spiderman. looks good. can´t wait ! The trailer alone is better than the whole emoji movie. Recently watched this. And it was amazing Best animated movie of 2018! <3 Sony can make a great movie.....but\n\n...HE CAN\'T DO IT ON COMMAND.... I feel like that end credit could play a part in the next Avengers.  Anyone else ? I really loved the animation of this movie Do animals talk in this dimension? Cos I don\'t want to freak him out 😂😂😂 THIS MOVIE WAS... EPIC!!! GREAT JOB SONY!!! Sony has come a LONG way since the Emoji Movie\n\n\nI think with this movie that is so undisagreably epic, revolutionary and magnificant.... we can forget the past mistake which was that previous film this was the best spiderman movie i have ever seen!! awesome... got the hype! Hell yeah congrats on the Oscar win 👏 I\'m soooo jealous of all the people who got to see this on the big screen!! This looks SPECTACULAR and AMAZING. This might be the ULTIMATE Spider-Man movie we\'ve been waiting for Man I hope this movie does really well in box office. Props to Sony for this incredibly creative and ballsy use of the spiderman license. Screw the repetitive disney/marvel formule crap. I just passed by to share my opinion after watching the movie. And I hope I’m not the only one who just was left wanting more, waiting to see what would happen between miles and Gwen :( I really hope they have a second movie! And now a second movie is incoming, thanks The Oscar deserved this movie. Who came here after watching the Spiderman far from home trailer? Yo im sorta diggin this new art direction with this movie. The action is super fluid and less motion intense scenes have this choppy look to it. Its sorta charming If you havn\'t watched this movie already i am just sayin, it\'s one of the best animated movies i have ever seen. Spider-Ham is killing me.\n\n“Oink! It can get weirder!” I went to watch this yesterday. I absolutely loved it :) recommend this movie such a masterpiece. what a great artist i have watched this movie so many times because it is awesome Cant wait to get this on DVD!! There are so many lit🔥🔥 songs for spiderverse which they haven\'t used in the trailer and very few times in the movie. I heard the album, and all of em are just dope🔥. If they would\'ve released the songs prior than just \'sunflower\' it would\'ve attracted much more audience after listening these songs. Every movie I see from now on has to compete with this one. This movie is sooo incredible!!!! :D I got to know what the music in this trailer is called. It\'s sooo AMAZING! You guys should make a second movie and make the original Spider-Man come back to life I got to say, Miles\'s Spider man suit look amazing like Spider man\'s Visual Bliss\nIn my list of top 5 movies They nailed the voice actor selections for this movie. I can’t wait to play Miles Morales with Into The Spider Verse suit on PS5 🔥 Now I want a Spider-Verse live action movie with Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and an older Tobey Mcguire.... Make this happen SONY!!! After tobey retired I never took interest in the other spider man movies cause they were shit! But this one is worth watching again and again! This is way up there with all the three spider man movies 🔥 After tobey retired I never took interest in the other spider man movies cause they were shit! But this one is worth watching again and again! This is way up there with all the three spider man movies 🔥 Hands down the best spiderman movie This movie is going to be amazing, ultimate and spectacular this was actually sick, watched at the cinema The Sam Raimi Spider-Man references 10/10 genial ya lo vi y es la mejor adaptación que han hecho de un manga, la verdad muy ingeniosos I saw this and it was amazing 💖😍 Awesome Movie! \nJust SAW IT! IT WAS AMAZING!!! Congratulations on winning in Oscars! 🎉🎉💕 2:20 “do animals talk in this dimension cuz I don’t wanna freak him out”\n\n-finest words Man the animators at Sony are so talented and just so awesome. I can’t even describe how grateful I am to the animators who made this. Edit: OK SO I JUST GOT BACK FROM WATCHING THE MOVIE AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!! I THOUGHT THE MOVIE LOOKED ALREADY GOOD FROM THE TRAILERS BUT SEEING IT IN THEATERS IN 3D  WAS MINDBLOWING!! But I’m not saying it was good just because of the animation. I liked everything about it. The plot and the characters were great. Overall a very good movie and highly recommend. It is just amazing mind blowing and inspiring 😃🥶 Just seen this film, it is fucking amazing! I want the sequel to have more screen time for Penni and Noir though. Peter B Parker : What makes you different is what makes you Spiderman \nMCU : We don\'t do that here. One of the greatest trailers ever. First time I watch this movie on cable TV when I admit on hospital due to coronavirus last April, this movie it kill my sadness and loneliness on hospital room. This movie is memorable for me. The kid that passed out was reading ""IMAGINE IF THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE SPIDER-MAN"" I have watched it before it’s so funny and cool it’s my favorite now :3 The biggest life lesson in this movie is to always tie your shoes I loved this movie. This is masterpiece Such an Amazing Movie. This was Stan Lee’s dream. And he didn’t get to see it. It’s not fair. Great animated movie, Miles Morales became my favorite character I just loved the trailer.. It looks brilliant.. This movie is so beautiful and entertaining 🖐🤧 Literally just saw this. BEST. MOVIE. EVER! 🕷 I need this in live action.... you know what I mean The animation was so lit. I love it!!!!!!! And we’re just that weird universe that has no heroes and a global pandemic They legit referenced every Spider-Man movie ever The best Spider-Man game followed by the best Spider-Man (or even comic-book) movie, that too in the same year. I never knew I was going to witness the best animated movie of human history I just watched this on Netflix and it was the best spiderman I\'ve ever seen. I watched the movie before seeing any trailers, and I\'m glad I did because this trailer reveals some kinda-spoilers that are best left to be found watching the movie first time through. We need more comic book animation movies with spder verse artstyle. I\'m really digging 30 year old Peter Parker\n\nHe\'s a chill dude The visual design of this movie was like nothing I have ever seen. It was a effing good movie! How the hell do I see this now after months??? This looks so pretty A lot of quotes in the trailer aren’t in the movie. And the movie has better music. It’s an amazing movie. I love this movie like its amazing! I refuse to believe this movie is almost 3 years old I want that popsicle and that album Would be cool if they release A Real life into the spiderverse movie with Tobey Maguire, Tom holland and Andrew Garfield! with they\'re own unique suits! That will be sick! funny thing i noticed. while peter, miles and gwen animated and drawn similar, noir is black and white with cellshading, peni parker have anime inspired look and spider-ham is straight up cartoon. that\'s just awesome! Love the combination of 2d and 3d I remember seeing this trailer when I went to the theater to see Venom. What a beautiful style of animation. I still don\'t understand how they did thatl. It\'s like 2d and 3d at the same time. Best Spiderman movie ever made.\nLove you SONY for giving us this masterpiece\nFar better than any movie from Disney MCU. THe best !!!!  Amazing  animation !!!!  Give us more !!! I usually hate Sony stuff, but this? This puts a smile on my face. The best movie ever! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Am I the only one who gets this sort of spiderman and rebellious feeling when I see trailers of it or listen to the soundtrack? just watched it on netflix hella awesome this movie! With great power and many spiders from other multiverses, comes great responsibility MARVEL, SONY ETC.... Tom Holland as the new spider man, the new spider man game was amazing, now this. Spider-Man really been killin it this year🔥 Bro i totally loved the movie but because it ended in such a way, it even gave me nostalgia wow its like watching spiderman again but with other universes 😁😖😭😫 I just watched the movie. It was awesome. If I was a “hero” I would be the person who says “I’m hungry” or “I’m tiredddd” every 10 minutes. This movie is amazing. this movie is just amazing, best spiderman movie Dude this animation style is dope Nice animation, nice characters, nice songs and nice movie. THAT SPIDEY ICE POP IS SO ACCURATE 😂 I hope they bring all of the live actors of who played Spider-Man to this series Best Spider-Man movie ever! Now it is in amazon prime... So happy Now its time to BRING BACK SPECTACULAR SPIDERMAN Love this movie I lost it when the picture of the spider man popsicle came up. I\'ll never forget that disappointment. I\'d love to see the art of this presented in a graphic novel and not just a companion art book. I know that seems backwards. I know when I get this on bluray I\'ll be pausing many scenes. Going to see this tonight in da theatre  sooo exciteddd BEST SPIDER MAN MOVIE EVER PEOPLE. WITH NEED MORE ANIMATED MARVEL MOVIES LIKE THIS ONE. The black sprayed spider uniform of Miles is so epic..and this movie is so amazing. 🎬🕷️🕸️ Movie was WAYYYY better than the trailer I love spiderman 2099, but I\'m so glad they got noir in the film\n\n\nNoir needs some love man IT WAS AMAZING. I CRIED. IT WAS FUNNY, EMPOWERING, INCREDIBLE. The fact that they put a representative of Hispanic/P.O.C in there was so dope and like wow ❤️❤️🥺 it was good a must watch who on earth disliked this? it\'s a masterpiece. In my top 5 movies list ❤️ The best movie I’ve seen all year. This movie shows that every Spider-Man is good tobey Andrew Tom etc The most unique animation style I have ever seen. BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE EVER, I COULD WATCH IT 50 MORE TIMES. Am I the only one who\'s genuinely more excited for Noir, Peni and Spider-Ham than the main trio? I want more movies with this great animation pleasseee Congrats on the Oscar! Congratulations to Sony! I had a long to watch an amazing animation movie! Last one was Wall-E....well done guys...wou could have all Marvel but you choose spider-man for 10.000.000 million! But dont worry Spider man is a power house...and yes ...in a cross over comic where superheroes form the future come to our time...they say that spider man was the most well know and respected super hero in history! The best of all of us...dont forget anyone can wear mask....much love boys and girls... Man, if someone skips the movie by 10 seconds, that is 1 year of work down the drain. Its soo good That its right up there with Spiderman 2. Are they implying that this is Tobey Maguire\'s Spider-man? That\'d be pretty cool, to he honest! After watching the song I appreciate it even more Just watched the movie now, I knew the movie was awesome and all beforehand, but didn\'t even watch the trailer.\n\nWhat I wanted to say is that this 1:36 completely caught me offguard, like, bruh moment This movie just proves Marvel is miles ahead of DC in terms of creativity and art of story telling. I mean after watching this movie I realized how much marvel has actually grown. DC looks like a pre school kid in front of brilliant artwork like this. I never saw this trailer, but oh I wish I had. I would have lost my mind with anticipation, and it would have been something I\'d never felt before I WANNA WATCH IT SO BAD! This movie was absolutely amazing,  but there’s one thing that angers me.... Miles is so frickin precious💛 The comic book covers are really nostalgic! Everyone when talking about the art style:\nIts beutiful,I\'ve looked at this for 5 hours now I remember those popsicles! xD\n\nAlso, Miles\' dad reaches peak Latino-ness when he demands his kid  tell him he loves him. A+++ on realistic accuracy of Latino parenting. Just sayin\'. This was 🔥 Imagine if Stan lee has a cameo in this movie Amazingly Awesome!! Nicolas Cage as Spider Noir \nBest movie ever. Such masterpeice movie and the most great thing they brought my favorite spiderman charecter in the post credit scene... I watch this great masterpiece movie 5 time and not even bored What makes you different, is what makes you Spider-Man. Fun Fact: when Stan Lee’s cameo appeared and he said I’ll miss him too, my older brother said “I’ll miss you too.” Sad and funny at the same time. Spider-Man: Miles Morales on PS5 anyone? 2:16 sold. I’m going to see it just for this scene! Loved this one I WANNA WATCH IT SO BAD!! Underrated asf ! such a masterpiece This is the best Spiderman Movie ever made and one of the best Movies i\'ve ever seen 0:47 was amazing i love how each spider person has a different animation style lol the mecha spider has a anime look and the pig got a looney toons type animation. The method of animation- or I don\'t even know what to call it at this point. jaw drop THIS MOVIE IS REALLY GREAT! I hope they do this in a real movie with real actor( tom,tobey, adrew..) I came back to this trailer because i actually miss the visuals sometimes 😂😭😭 This was the trailer ( and some friends) that sold me on this movie\nSo glad for that!!;) I\'m so glad Spiderman-Noir and Spider-Ham have such good voice actors But I never knew he could be so smart and strong in the full movie wow never knew that The Jordan’s fit the black and red Spider-Man suit for miles This is one of the best spider man stories evermade next to spider man 2 Twice already. Can watch again. Love it. This is a amazing movie Can’t wait to see this tomorrow night! with my favorite The city that is virtually shown is actually the city of Mumbai in India 🇮🇳😍 . The background music of Fight Scene was played by Indian Tanpura Music Instrument. Sony Pictures has done this for Indian fans. Thank you Sony Pictures for keeping the Indian reference .😍🥰 love from India 🇮🇳♥❤💕. Rip Stan Lee. Thank you for spiderman and all the other heroes. You will forever be in our hearts. Another legend gone. R.I.P BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE OF 2019!!!! The movie was OUT STANDING. Sad I didn\'t stay for the end credit scene, would have been so freaking worth it. I have seen this movie and its THE BEST Am I the only one waiting patiently for them to make a Spider-Gwen film? Yes.. a live action film.. My favorite movie of all time Spider-Man Noir is voiced by Nicholas Cage and Spider-Ham is voiced by John Mulaney.\nI just felt the need to mention this. For you Stan Lee, this was one of your swansongs. CANT WAIT TO SEE 😄💕💕 Soooo good..only one other movie that made me this happy was Lego Congrats for winning Oscars! What makes you different, is what makes you Spider-Man  1:52 But does it make you\nF E E L\nlike Spider-Man? and the oscar for best animated movie goes to the spider man into the spider verse ♥️ This is one of the few films I would pay to see again willingly. Little did we know that this would be soooo goood This Movie is A instant Classic Today is The Anniversary of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse!!! A bunch off my friends and I went to the cinema to see this for a preview (dec 12 instead off when it officially came out in dec 14) so we all wore Spider-Man merchandise for the movie.. I wore a full hood mask and suit themed around Spider-Man and when the my scene came on were everyone was dressed as Spider-Man I honestly felt like I was in the movie... I need to watch this 😭 This movie was 10x better than the trailer Judigng by the trailer I thought it was a comedy relief movie, but the movie itself turned out to be much more emotional. Thank you Stan Lee. Thank you... Who here is still watching this trailer in 2020 and excited for the sequel in 2022? Masterpiece Jeff: I love you Miles\nMiles: Yeah I know dad see ya Friday\nJeff: You gotta say I love you back\nMe on the floor dying laughing:😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I genuinely hope this is one of the years best. I can’t comprehend how amazing it looks Masterpiece The animation was very great We Need More Of Miles And Millions Of Story\'s @sony @marvel...... We Want More The movie so good it made me forgive Sony for Emoji Movie, Ghostbusters 2016, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Who here after hearing a live action spider verse is in the works Mr. Stark, i don\'t feel so good. ""Do animals speak in this dimension, cuz I don\'t wanna freak him out"" 😂😂 YES SONY THIS IS WHAT WE WANT This can be called a “sequel” but come on, this is an original idea for a sequel! mind blowingly good! i love this movie This movie surpassed my very expectations it was AMAZING “So you want to learn to be Spider-Man.”\n\n“Can you teach me?” Stan Lee\nRest in Peace\nMarvel Legend\n1922 - 2018 I wish i could delete my memory to experience this movie like the first time again I miss those days when I watched this movie. Literally legends wait for   Spiderman :no way home  2021😍😍😍 Just came back from it and personally is worth the watch like seriously it\'s fucking amazing Best Movie Ever! 2018 is Spider-man’s year. No doubt about it. This needs more love who else stayed through the whole super long credits in the cinema to watch the end credits scene I wish they made an avatar the last air bender movie because the characters wear blue ya lo vi y la verdad la mejor interpretación de manga y película ingenioso ! Miles’ father look like the father from cloudy with a chance of meatballs The animation style seems like what a stop-motion Big Hero Six might look like. The first animated proyect of Spider-Man,and it rocks. Wait are they actually referring to The Original Spider-Man movie series wow sony I can’t wait to watch this THIS JUST WON BEST ANIMATED FEATURE YESTERDAY AT THE OSCARS. PHENOMENAL JOB AND WELL DESERVED SPIDEY What a style, this movie will be iconic. “What makes you different is what makes you Spider-Man” ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Love that Something that I just noticed after being obsessed with this movie for months: the fry scene isn’t in the final cut of the movie. How did I never notice that? Wait, did this movie win the Oscar for best animated feature in 2019?\nDid you guys forgot it won, or it me?\nLol John Mulaney as Spider-Ham is great, but is NO ONE gonna talk about Nic Cage being Spider-Man Noir? Anyone at all? I wonder why so many dislikes??? Well, anyway... What A MASTERPIECE This Movie Is!!! 😎 Nearly 1 year until the sequel and I just can’t wait (also has anybody actually realised how many scenes must have been deleted from the final copy cos I’m seeing many different scenes in this trailer) Bro im late but i need another movie of this gwen and miles together😭 Its great, but I wonder how it would look with dynamic camera animation like AOT i love this movie I\'m kinda glad that the trailer isn\'t as good as the movie, because when i watched it in the theater, it\nBlew.\nMe.\nAway. What an animation man awesome I like how Spider-Ham actually admits he\'s weird. best movie i\'ve seen in a while Won Oscar® for best animated feature in 2019 If this movie was a tie-in video game it would be called. ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse: The Video Game I already want a spin off with Nic Cage\'s Noir Spider Man Love how they incorporated it with the gane Love the direct movie references from 0:10 to 0:14. Amazing! Another thing: i wish this movie were a game, some of these backgrounds look like fun shooter game stages Coolest animation ever! Best movie ever!!! I swear I just rewatched this like 100 times This is movie is perfect af Everyone: Infinity war is the best crossover movie\nSONY: hold my beer I loved the shoes incorporated into the movie Ok, this is probably my second favorite animated film of 2018, with Ralph 2 taking number one. It is also my third favorite superhero movie of 2018, with Infinity War taking number one and Aquaman taking number two. One of the best movies ive watched\n\nWatched on a school trip lol looks so good I LOVE THE MOVIE I LOVE THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All aboard the Hype Train. Would have been cool if sony maintained the same look/feel/style for the ps5 game. Maybe an optional filter mode? Saw the movie. Greatest animation story character all. I wish they did a Series Awesome movie I hope the Sequel is as Good (or better) Anyone Here After Spider Man Across The Spider Verse (Part One) Trailer This movie was fan-fucking-tastic, just left the theater and loved it! Im not gonna lie the music in the trailer is amazing Just got back from the theaters, this was the best movie I\'ve seen in a LONG time. I\'m going back to see it again this weekend lol I thought this movie was only going to rely on it\'s heroes and unique animation. Boy was I wrong. This was one of the best superhero films I\'ve seen, I can\'t believe I initially found it cringy With great power comes with great responsibility It was a beeping awesome movie. Surely it was the best spider man ever Sick man!! We\'re gonna see Spider-Ham and Noir Spider too!! Spider-man: woh, you\'re just like me!\nMiles: impossible One of the greats. Stan Lee approves I sure love this film It would be awesome if in future their is a Spiderman movie in which Toby,Andrew and Tom all come together in a screen. Jack Frost\'s Peter Parker could be my fav The end credit scene better be that Christmas album Best Spider-Man film ever! No contest! It is perfect! Who else thinks we need a life action version of this with Seth Rogan as the older spiderman? What makes you different, is what make you spiderman!! Just take a Leap of faith!!!😂😂😂❤️ i can\'t imagine this is really we gonna see in marvel new movie spiderman no way home. "".... and a So-So popsicle"" \ndunno why but that made me laugh harder than it probably shouldve This movie is fire 🔥 so good 🐐 Marvel: Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover event.\n\nMe: Into the Spider-Verse When we saw Stan Lee in this movie, my theater was just like “Woo!” And they also clapped a bit too. This movie ROCKS!!!! I actually really liked this movie. I was disappointed at first when I saw that this first Spiderman movie with Spiderman being black was not live action, but I wanted it to win the Academy Award for best Animated movie when it won.\n\nI am mostly a white person basically, but I am really hoping that a live action Spiderman movie with Spiderman being black will happen. Wow, this came out 3 YEARS AGO? I saw this movie around 3 times This animation is like nothing else.... it\'s awesome 😵 This is the best movie eveeeerrr! 2018 was a great year for spiderman This movie was a visual marvel!\n\nI\'ll see myself out... This was Sony\'s apology for The emoji movie and I think it was accepted pretty well Now we can become Miles man! As dumb as it may sound, what I’m looking the most forward to in this film ain’t Miles Morales, ain’t Peter Parker, ain’t even Gwen or Spider Ham, I say no. What I can’t wait for is to hear good ol’ “I could eat a peach for hours” Nicolaus Cage voice Spider-Man noir XD This still cures depression, even today I love how in the video he said Brooklyn in the leap of faith better then when he said it in the tunnel Guys this movie is so amazing it’s amazing if anything was amazing it be this this be amazing Honestly I need an Xbox game now of this Dude how was wreck it ralph 2 even close to winning the oscar? That was a stupid cash grab but they poured their heart and souls into this and created the best superhero movie to date John mulaney as spider ham...\n\nLedgendary 11/10 I am from India, I love Hollywood movies and I love MARVEL and also I am very glad too see this movies won Oscar😍👍 No Lie That Disappointing Spider-Man Popsicle Was My Life As A Kid THIS LOKS SOOOO GOOOOODDD! I\'M SO EXCITED Just saw the trailer, didn\'t know i needed this movie so much, question is, should i make the kids watch the raimi trilogy before we all dive deep into this? No buildings were harmed in the making of this movie. Sony pictures + Marvel studios = Ultimate movie! Is this the multiverse they were talking in far from home trailer?? Wondering if Ironman could be alive in an alternate timeline... ""What happened to you?""\n""Oh, I\'m not in the movie because I didn\'t feel to good."" I just got it! Miles replies ""I know"" to his dad saying he loves him! This is was incredible I have a few problems with the plot first when miles looks into the comic book and how would they come up with peter b Parker im pretty sure someone would take notice of that and spider gwen hiw was she there without the other dimensions opening hmmm this is the best movie of 2018 period. 2:16 ITS SO FUNNY SCENE😂😂😂 I love how Peni Parker (Anime spider mech) is embarrassed in the last scene with a huge red blush like in an Anime. This movie will be amazing. technically there are infinite, but only a few have been shown in this movie.\n\nif you look at the animated series there are at least 10x as many spider people I\'m 34 and I can\'t even lie this movie was 🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂 just remember that one second of an animation tok one week for an artist to make Oh gosh hearing Jake Johnson voice Spider-Man makes me just imagine Nick from New Girl trying to be this athletic but awkwardly failing I love Spider-Man movies ""Do animals talk in this dimension coz I don\'t want to freak him out""😂😂😂 0:20 Peter\'s jump oh god it\'s gonna be my wallpaper This movie should get that freakin oscar😤 Joe Perry nos 0:02 segundos de trailer ❤️ The movie has a dope soundtrack not gonna lie At first when I saw this after I watch infinity war, I asked “how is spiderman alive”? Best cartoon since The Avatar: The last airbender This was the best Spiderman Film forever ^^ but and a saddest 😭😭💥 Apart from the awesome animation... can we appreciate the homages it made to the raimi films in the beginning? now that is AMAZING. ""It can get weirder""\nObviously if John Mulaney decides to drift off the script. Remember: The people who made The Emoji Movie also made Spider Verse. That\'s insane. Sony Pictures Animation in 2017:\nThe Emoji Movie\nWHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!?!?! Best movie ever existence! Awesome movie! Although im kinda salty that there isnt a live action Miles Morales movie, i really cant be mad, the animation is beautiful. I wonder why they arent including the Scarlet Spider. SPEECHLESS FOR THIS MOVIE . THE COOLEST EDIT ALL TIME !!! CANT WAIT FOR NEXT WORK !!! AMAZING WORK 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸 Wow, this movie should at least win an oscar 2:20 hilarious haha The animation in this movie continues to remind me of the animation in the much underrated Peanuts movie God damn this movie is dope I really how Venom gives a short preview of this movie\nAbsolutely loving this already. That spider Miles was bitten was glitching right? What if in the next film Miles might start glitching? Cause I’m concerned. The Kingpin looks like Boss Baby ate too many chicken nuggets  lol Still the best superhero film My son wants to see this this weekend.\nLooks cool.\nBut even if it looked like crap, I\'d take him anyway.\nLol One of the best movies This is the best Marvel movie ever made and it ain’t even canon. We must riot! Great anime film..really enjoyed it. gotta love the Sam Raimi references in this trailer one of the best animations of all time!! ( Kanye west voice ) Lucas out of stranger things would be a good miles for a real life spider verse just watched this for the first time. 19 but this movie is amazing for an all ages movie!!!! its a top all ages movie like shrek and how to train your dragon. You guys should make a sequel 😎 Wait but the purple guy (uncle of miles ) so if he saw miles face, how does he not know its him?!? GREATEST TIME TO BE A SPIDER-MAN FAN FIRST SPIDER-MAN PS4 THEN THIS BE GREATER FOLKS The perfect movie doesnt exs-- This movie was pure gold ""Officer, love u\nHehe.. wait What?"" So if Miles an Aussie, he would be called Kilometers, right? Km for short Yo ngl I\'m watching this trailer video 2 years after the movie came out..... And this is the best trailer for the movie It\'s official bois! It\'s an Oscar winner!!\n\nEdit: Holy nuts, 1k likes! Thanks so much, doods! They should make a PART 2 NoneI don\'t care when it comes out, but give them as much time as they need. The first movie took multiple long years so I feel the second should have as much care and love put into it, not a rush thing. I would like to see the assembled arachnid trinity (Tobey, Andrew and Tom) Not to be a partypooper, but this is not a teaser. This is an announcement, and clickbaity announcement at most. There is not a single frame of footage/animation from the sequel. Nevertheless, I am excited for it. Despite seeing this type animation style before in an iron man and captan america animated movie, this movie really pushes the bounderies of what can this animation style can really do. I look forward to see how this style being implemented in future projects. Haha wouldn\'t it be funny if Tobey, Andrew and Tom met from different universes in the next film?\n\n\'I thought i was the only one!\' As they finger-gun point at each other This movie is definitely a masterpiece Okay from the looks of it they will be adding from the instant logo changes:\nJapanese Spider-Man (Supaidāman) Earth-51778\nSpider-Punk Earth-138\nSpider-UK Earth-833 me : *sees first movie*\nI love it!\nalso me : *sees first movie trailer as the sequel trailer*\nI\'M SO F*KIN EXCITED Mile : okay let\'s do this one last time for real\nSpider people : hold my arachnid 1st movie we see the spiders in Miles universe\n 2nd movie i Hope we see Miles going to other spider-people universes Oh boy Miles will return in 2022 with his story & his movie I can’t wait for this to drop Let’s Do This One.  I Got Something that might be cool\nMiles: “Why are there so many Spider people coming to my Universe.”\nMiguel aka Spiderman 2099: “Hey Kid Were gonna need you for something.”\nThat would be awsome I cant wait to watch this I’d would like to see Mayday Parker/Spider-Girl from Earth-982, Raimi’s Spider-Man, MCU Spider-Man, and Spider-Man 2099 since he was in the post credit scene in the first film. I hope there’s going to be a romantic relationship between Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy. Love the trailer its so cool Also in the movie after miles defeated King Pin, he starts looking down towards a bunch of webs of different colors sin space. This goes on for a bit I just wanted to point that out. Also when he does the shoulder touch on King Pin it say HEY behind him lol. Then Miles\'s dad says C-Mobile instead of T-Mobile lol! So, this movie\'s gonna be released the day after I turn 16. Best. Present. Ever. Tobey’s Spider-Man is from Earth-96283\nAndrew’s Spider-Man is from Earth-120703\nand...\nTom’s Spider-Man is from Earth-199999 When you realize only 79 more years till 2099 and then we will be able to see 2099 Spider-Man:(❍ᴥ❍ʋ)  yo what\'s up and it\'s like this, I do not care when Spider-Man into the spider-verse part 2 movie comes out at all, I just wanted to come out. We all want this to come out as soon as possible and yes we\'re all going to love it as well. The first movie was excellent and out of this world and I know the second one is going to be the same way too. I sure love this film We’ll probably get a teaser this year then a trailer soon after Me: I would like to see the real trailer, please.\n\nGets this Let\'s hope it is coming in 2022 I legit thought 2022 was gonna take so long but in reality it\'s already like 1 year I never knew a second movie is coming on 2018 Spider-Man : Into The Spider Verse 2 Sequel is  is  Damn I can’t believe this teaser was a year ago already last time I checked it was 6 months ago Remember me in 2022 It sucks cause they announced it for 2021 and now we gotta wait  super excited Spider Verse 2 Sequel is  is  Wow I just wanted to see the second trailer I Like A Trailer But... How Miles Gets His Friends Back Without Gitching? Spider Verse 2 Sequel Is  is  I can wait to this movie next year I’d like them to touch on the cartoon universes Wait we might get spider verse 2 but no footage only footage from first movie Ughhhh I have to wait 3 years to get the sequel to the best movie of 2018 and it comes out the same year as that Minecraft movie I\'m so confused, is this clickbait it be nice when he goes to other dimensions besides his that i one of them he meet his uncle aaron again and goes through kinda what peter b parker and gwanda like in the original spider-verse movie This is a trailer for the first one. Not the second one. Sooo um, you realize that, or.... There better be bully maguire as a main character Now we in the end game The first 2022 was a real teaser Sony uploaded it on their Twitter I think and at 0:04 pause reference of negative the villain if u have played PS4 Spiderman so it can be that he is the main villain but not sure This is the trailer for the first movie. miles does have a minute he actually has 2-3 years This will be sony\'s 7th spider-man movie 2022....... this is an animated film, and this is gonna take them a full year?,,,,,, FINALLY This is just the first trailer for the first movie joooooooojooo am sooo  hyped hopefully I live until next year to watch it.
