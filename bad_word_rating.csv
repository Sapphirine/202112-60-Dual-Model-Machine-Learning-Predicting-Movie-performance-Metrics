HeÃ¢ÂÂs All That,"['XqTPaRz8Nx8', 'CldGTG6iVrU', 'PaZVjZEFkRs', 'N-ewaCVARtM', '4sYSyuuLk5g']","['HeÃ¢Â\x80Â\x99s All That Ahh y’all remember the days when people actually had to audition and work hard to get lead roles in movies? I really liked how they made us watch the whole movie in 2 minutes If Addison got some award for this film, I would dig my own grave. Whoever made this trailer didn\'t want us to watch the whole movie. I couldn\'t stop laughing at this cause it just gives disney channel vibes 😂 Warning ⚠️ this is not a remake of she’s all that, this is a reminder of the dystopian nightmare we live in. The only thing missing in this trailer was the end credits. Plot twist: He was beautiful all along without that haircut. How creative. Why does Netflix portray teenagers the way literally no teenager behaves? Showing the whole movie in 3 mins is also a talent Thank you for sharing the whole movie to the people who can\'t afford a netflix subscription!! <3 Normal teen : Mostly average guy with a lot of responsibility , goes to school, studies, has few hobbies, may or may not be in relationship. \nNetflix teen : Sex , Love , Lust I can officially say I’ve watched “He’s All That” before the movie even came out. If Addison can be an actress then I’ll be one too Watching this makes me realize how I really miss the old era of highschool movies  ( the 90s And the 2000-2009 period) It’s devastating to know that some people out there are working really hard to make it big in the acting industry, but with the help of internet fame one can posts dance vids and suddenly become an actress and singer.... remember when people trained for years to get a role and got casted for having talent and being a good actor and not because of their popularity. Good ol days The guy was already pretty cute , they just shortened his hair . Lord protect my brain cells . Forget the bad acting, the trailer outlines the entire movie BTW, will there ever again be a teen movie where being an influencer does not drive the plot? It\'s funny that being famous makes you a singer, an actress, a beauty influencer all of a sudden. So many great actresses out there so many other underrated choices. Yet she was chosen because she has a high following? Anne with an E was cancelled for this? I feel bad for the next generation honestly Yes, go on, please keep telling the whole story in the trailer. It saves me so much time ☺️ I miss the classic movies from the 90s and early 2000s this just isn’t the same :( the fact that kourtney agreed to think makes me think she needs addison as much as addison needs her.. just can’t be cant believe she got a chance in a movie by swinging her arms in her room for 5 seconds 😔 Well that was an interesting movie. I\'m not a hater on any of the \'main\' TikTokers but they really cancelled some good ass shows for this? I mean c\'mon, this is the basic teen movie genre that you can literally see anywhere. Wow, and imagine the multiple auditions and callbacks  of aspiring actors and actresses who actually trained for years and have a really great potential but not casted. ""Not Another Teen Movie"" with Chris Evans was a parody of these kinds of movies. That was great. This trailer legit gave EVERY SINGLE BIT OF THe STORY , like there is no reason to watch this tiktok bs I’ve been paralyzed for the last five years and yesterday my friend came over and put he’s all that on. Suddenly I gained the strength to rise from my chair and turn that trash ass movie off💯💯💯 thank you Addison! In case for some people who didn\'t noticed the movie is a remake of ""She\'s all that"" and the actress who plays Padgett mother was the lead actress of the 1999 movie sad to see that this is the kind of movie that becomes successful while shows like Anne with an E have to be cancelled... bring back anne with an e, the society and all the good tv shows you’ve cancelled and then i’ll watch this movie bruh This trailer literally showed us the whole movie at this point The main thing everyone always mocked the original for was the fact that the supposed “ugly girl” was obviously a very attractive person who simply had glasses and a ponytail. \nThis would’ve been a good opportunity to try something a bit different and have the ugly character actually be a fat nerd or someone with a physical deformity or something.  The fact that someone like Addison Rae could get famous really is a sad reflection on our society But who needs to hang out with the popular kids when you can just hang out with horses instead? IS EVERYONE GONNA IGNORE THAT HER MOTHER IS PLAYED BY THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THE ORIGINAL FILM?!?!? thanks! I basically watched the whole movie in two minutes I guess you can get the lead role on Netflix by just moving your hands now. Director of mean girls- \ngive me a bloody break I can literally write the whole plot rn 💀 I still can’t believe that they had THE Madison Pettis on this movie and they still chose the lead that they chose 👀 How generous of you Netflix ☺️ You let me watch the whole movie in 2 minutes 💅🏻 Peppa Pig jumps in deeper puddles than this. A movie about not being super attractive makes you weird and an outcast. Y’all really just showed the whole movie in 2 mins 😭 They literally just gave us the entire movie in 2mins 💀 Hi im coming back after watching the movie, its a typical plot but the acting is actually better than what i expected !!! Addison and Tanner chemistry is cute tbh and the ending credit is adorable. This is like the perfect girl\'s movie! We both get to realise our sadistic desire to manipulate decent guys AND the emotional rollercoaster that comes with it. Wish Netflix would make more movies like this. If Addison can be anything\nEveryone in this world are talented as heck Honestly, I enjoyed watching the movie. And I guess that\'s because I didn\'t have any prejudice towards the cast. I\'ve heard a few things about the lead girl Addison and the things I heard were all full of hate and negativity. If you feel that way about her, that\'s your prerogative. All I\'m saying is you don\'t have to badmouth the movie just bc it\'s not your cup of tea. Hate it, cringe at it, but why slander it? Try to remove your biases against the people on it and you might actually enjoy if not tolerate it. The film doesn\'t have to be the best or be extremely amazing to deserve decency or respect. A lot of people behind the film worked their asses off and tried their best to execute it. Too many people are projecting so much negativity into the world. It\'s alarming. So they just showed the entire movie? Her boyfriend cheated on her, she wants revenge. Picks a random guy and gives him a makeover, they fall in love, he finds out he’s a project then forgives her. this was such a fun movie! the writing, the actors, the way they played with the tropes and avoided falling into the problematic ones.. loved it! if only the trailer didn’t spoil like the entire movie 😂 Someone should make a parody trailer but with an actress who can act as the lead I hate society just a little more now. I’m confused as to whether it’s her terrible acting or the fact that Addison Rae looks like she’s legit in her 30’s. 🤦🏻\u200d♂️\n\nJfc, the original had some soul in it. The whole movie is literally in the trailer 💀😭 Let’s just sum it up:\nThis is a Disney plot\nKourtney is in this &\nWe already know the entire plot of the movie just from the trailer Being a famous tiktoker basically means being a singer/actress/influencer/beauty guru/celebrity nowadays. I- How to have a glow up in a Netflix movie:\n1. Already be attractive\n2. Shave The way that they fell for each other is like in those dumb Hallmark movies, where it’s like in a week they fall in love and live happily ever after in the end Honestly I\'ve watched the movie like 5x and i can easily give it 8/10 rating, yes it has some cringy moments, but the story is honestly good. I also don\'t think Addison\'s act is bad or any of the actors that worked in the movie. People just hate the movie because it\'s Addison that acted, if it wasn\'t Addison for sure this movie will receive better reviews What kind of tall handsome dude with six pack abs who rides horses is unpopular? It feels like that addison is that person who you ask to rehearse your lines with before the scene and you put all the emotions alright but the other person just reads the paper and just wave around. She is not that bad but just not be too loose or too energetic, like she is going off the frames or not even trying. I\'ve never watched a single Netflix movie from start to finish but seeing as I love the original ""She\'s all that"" movie I guess I\'ll have to watch this as well...pray for me guys. idc what y’all say, I’m gonna eagerly watch this movie just like I’ve watched every bad rom com on netflix Addison acted so well \nI love how she played her character 😘😘 I had my doubts about this film at first because nothing can compare to ""She\'s All That,"" but it turned out to be better than I had anticipated. It had a lot of awkward, funny moments that accurately reflected high school realism and the broader social media mania, something not many movies do. If you enjoy romantic comedies, I strongly suggest this film. The plot was predictable, as it had been since the announcement, so there was no real surprise there. 1:55 ""I\'ve really screwed up Mom""     -__-\n\nIncredible acting I really want to be an actor but it\'s seeming to get harder and harder as more and more people get picked for lead roles just because they have a bunch of followers. Addison\'s acting isn\'t the worst acting I\'ve ever seen but she\'s probably at the same level of acting talent as me and right now I\'m still doing background acting. Has she even taken acting classes? imagine practising acting every day and going to audition for a lead role and then a tik toker who never acted before gets it just because she is famous. IDK who chose Addison  but wth were they thinking LMAO I understand that the internet can be a cruel place, but are we really supposed to believe that many people turned on her because she got mad that she found her boyfriend cheating on her? Her response was perfectly justified. It’s crazy how tanner is acting in this while acting in cobra Kai, imagine how full his schedule is Man why mess with a classic "" shes all that "" !! No one can beat Freddie Prinze jr ❤️ this was one of the best movies i have ever watched in my life. i cried so many times i lost count and i feel in love with all the characters excpet Jordan omg WHAT A WASTEMAN HOW COULD HE DO THAT TO HER! Having addison as the protagonist already shows the decline of this movie Honestly, we should appreciate the person who made this trailer. Saved us from watching the movie. Addison Rae is the perfect example why being good looking is not everything. netflix just basically showed us the whole movie I mean her acting is OKAY considering the story line but, Netflix cancelled Anne with an E for THIS?\n\nOkay I just found out that it happened because of a problem with CBC but still......... lol at the people going ""the trailer gave it away!"" while ignoring the fact that it\'s a straight up remake of a very very popular teen movie from less than 25 years ago. That literally looks like something me and my sister\'s made for fun It’s an amazing film for 9-16 year olds with an amazing twist 😉 Addison Rae isn\'t a bad actor, it\'s just that she\'s inexperienced. I know this isn’t gonna be an amazing movie but I’ll be honest with myself I’m gonna end up watching it. It\'s confirmed. Netflix is bad at making trailers. I literally just watched the whole movie concept. I actually enjoyed this movie. Take it for what it is, it\'s a teen movie what else do you expect? For it to be Oscar worthy? Look, I\'m a grown woman and I\'m extra hype for this! She\'s All That is an absolute 90\'s classic!!!!\nLove that they cast Rachael Lee Cook as the mom. Nice touch! Conclusion: Just because you are famous does not mean you can act. I know it\'s a bad movie when I can watch a trailer less than 3 minutes long and I already know the entire plot and everything else there is to know about the film. i think that movies used to be so glamorous, the hollywood scene was so much different. i get sad about time passing. modern movies don’t have the same feel to them. older movies used beautifully styled outfits, had beautiful soundtracks. now everyone dresses in influencer style outfits, they have tik tok tween pop and rap songs. i miss old movies with the hollywood stars, but now anyone can be a hollywood star. i miss movies where social media and influencers and “followers” wasn’t in the plot. before it just all seemed so real and beautiful. art is dying... Tbh her acting isnt too bad from just watching the trailer, but this movie just seems really generic lol. Definitely something I\'ve seen before multiple times. 💀 This is just a resume booster for Tanner, the man has a big future ahead of him. Must have been hard on his back to carry the shitty co-stars acting. Bless up Tanner,  I don\'t blame you my guy. I miss when trailers didn’t give you the whole movie. Even if it’s a remake… leave something to the imagination. People in general should stop being haters. Love how this trailer pretty much showed us the entire movie, so we don\'t have to sit through hours of that shit. Kudos Netflix! Who else was attracted to him before the makeover?  I was sold when he said\' ""I don\'t want to stare at your underwear while I eat.""  I always love the rebels. I love this movie period!💜 From this trailer, there\'s really no reason to watch the movie anymore. Important things have been laid out. We\'ve watched the whole movie in 2 minutes. I\'m only watching this for tanner because he\'s actually a good actor and I like his projects he\'s done I\'m actually excited about how bad this is going to be\n\nEdit: Oh shit it\'s happening I couldn’t help but laugh the whole time 🤣 After watching this movie I felt I could be an actress without acting lesson. Throughout the entire movie I wished I had been watching it with someone next to me so we could have made fun of this monstrosity together. Laughing and mumbling \'huh..? wha-...? wtf...?\' to myself was just not working like it used to.  If this is what future teen movies are gonna be like I might just go insane It was a nice film. Happy to see two stars (Rachael Leigh Cook and Matthew Lillard) from the original film, too! The movie was so good. Literally, I dont have a background of who the casts were. But they portrayed it really well. I just dont see why some of the comments are mean. Coz I was so into it ✨ I even followed them after watching. They literally spoiled the whole movie on this trailer LMAOOOO Looks like a cute retelling of a classic story but for the teens of today. I tend to stick with teen rom coms from the early 2000s but this one may not be too bad. Many of the comments expect it to be award winning... it\'s not. It\'s just a fun summer movie. Take it for what it is. I think is a good cast in a bad movie (i\'m talking \'bout Tanner, Madison and Peyton) they have other projects that really show their talent. This movie is basic and cliche but is what a lot of people watch, it is number 1 in Netflix in a lot of countries. I hope we can see Tanner, Madison, and Peyton working together again but in a movie worth of their talent :)) The only thing I love about this film, is my boy Tanner using his moves in Cobra Kai ... Attaboy I feel like this is gonna be the most hilarious movie of \'21 So an influencer who can\'t act, portraying an influencer, getting embarrassed online losing followers makes a guy over, with a Kardashian cameo thrown in for some star power ? Pass 🤮 Don\'t know why but every movie on Netflix literally has the same plot... Robby doesn’t deserve this 💀 just finished watching it, i’d say even though the plot is predicted it is really good and Addison is very good in here💗💗 If he was the nerdy type, with glasses and books like in the original, this would be more believable. I like how they showed the whole movie not just the trailer NOTHING LIKE THIS WILL EVER REPLACE THE 90S GREATEST this is truly depressing, netflix has room for this, the kissing booth, tall girl, but doesn\'t seem to have room for the society or i am not ok with this, with people who can actually act? it’s honestly so annoying how everyone keeps blaming Addison for getting these opportunities— yeah it might seem annoying that she didn’t have to go through the rough experiences of auditioning and forming her career from nothing, but she is just taking advantage of what she has, like anyone would. If you have the opportunity to star in a movie I’m sure you would. Y’all really just need to chill This is why social media is becoming problematic for actors. Stupid casting directors use followings as an indication of talent. Another movie added to my feel-good list!😍♥️🌸 I dont know about you guys, but im loving this movie!!! The soundtracks here were lit!!🔥🔥 caught myself singing along to it😍 I cannot explain what am i feeling today after i watched it. The movies was great and awesome i love their chemistry 💗 I loved this movie. Addison did a good job considering it’s her first movie. ♥️♥️ Damn, this actually looks like it could be a new age classic. Can’t wait to see the full film. this is hands down the greatest movie i’ve ever watched all that was missing was a touch of olive oil Considering that this is her first time acting I think Addison actually did a pretty decent job. Of course it\'s not the best and they could\'ve casted someone better for sure but i was expecting way worse, specially after watching how bad dixie was in that little medical show or whatever it was. The one second scene of Matthew Lillard dancing is the best part of the trailer I enjoyed this movie a lot. It was so much fun Just once I would love to see one of the girls pick someone that looks like Napoleon Dynamite, McLovin, or Sherminator from American Pie. The type that would actually be seen as a true outcast in a high school. Show reality. oh wow! this movie was so great. i cried. best 2:27 minutes of my life Ok. I am going to be completely honest. There were a lot of cringey and hated moments but there were some moments for which I laughed. Yes,laughed. Tanner did a good job in playing Cameron- the antisocial guy who just hates everybody but I disliked how he just fell immediately for Padgette. I mean they had one honest convo at the station and they have feelings for each other??! Cameron\'s sister did a good job for the crying scene and I loved Nisha and wished she had more screen time. And where is Freddie Prince Jr?!!!?! I have mixed feelings about this movie. The writer for this movie was one of the writers for the show Friends, and the director of this movie was the director for Mean Girls. It might not be THAT bad of a movie. I really hate the emphasis they’ve put on social media in this. This is obviously aimed at younger teens and it’s making social media and the internets perception of you so much more important than it should ever be. I get they want to be relevant but this just seems so toxic and sad. Watched this as a hate watch but honestly, didn\'t hate it as much as I thought I would. Decent guilty pleasure watch. Madison all grown up & I still see her as the adorable lil ballerina from the Game Plan. omg cant wait for this. gonna put it on repeat for you addi <3 Vedo solo commenti negativi di questo film, a me sembra assolutamente bellissimo, e mi è piaciuto un casino! Not them literally narrating the whole plot in a trailer, I think now I don\'t have to waste my 2 hours and also i feel Addison did a pretty fine job. I wanna watch this it\'s gonna be hilarious her acting tho 😭💀 Definitely, will go into the not recommend section. Anyways, who’s excited for Stranger Things Season 4? OK Y\'all I just watched this movie here is what\'s up: it\'s kinda low budget and the acting is about what you expect, but there were some seriously great moments. When they showed the reveal that\'s at 1:34 while watching the movie, my jaw literally dropped i swear to god. Not to spoil it but there were a few very very nice moments that made this movie very enjoyable. Although I don’t like Addison, I watched the film and it’s actually really good. It’s not one of those typical cringey teen drama movies. I definitely recommend watching it 😌 I didn’t know the actress was actually a famous tik toker until now but when I saw the movie I thought she had the most beautiful smile and would make it as an actress Beautiful people just get everything at this point. I’m convinced. 💀 But good for her, she’s doing great for herself and is taking opportunities! Love it! 🥰 Ngl, this movie is just like any other plot in wattpad. Remember when you would watch a movie like Flight Plan or Mirrors or even John Tucker Must Die and those movies would stick with you because they were so memorable. Our kids will never know. The film isn\'t that bad. They have the high school vibes on it, and how school and the social media can be BS. I don\'t like her, but the cast and crew did great imo.\nI\'ve seen the interview, Tanner being so appreciative to her and saying she\'s too hard to herself, etc.\nThey\'re just so wholesome. Yall won\'t understand because you already closed them as bad people in your heads. The movie was great Addison did an amazing job LOL I literally loved it (and no I’m not saying this bc I’m a fan bc I’m not nor a hater) I love how Kourtney Kardashion makes a surprise appearance in the trailer somebody give addison an oscar for this amazing acting I see what y’all did there Netflix…the girl from “She’s all that” is now a parent in “He’s all that”. I see you!!!! These are all things ppl hate about this era in one movie. Congrats Netflix its kinda genius from a certain point of view. Honestly her acting is pretty good considering it’s her first movie Rachel leigh cook looks exactly the same as she did all those years ago 😭😭❤️ I\'m so proud of you girl!!! I\'m sure u killed it addi! luv u<3 This is the first netflix movie i didn\'t enjoy and i usually enjoy netflix movies :v The acting and the script.. could\'ve been better. I mean i really liked the original movie so whenever movies like these come out i usually get excited. as long as y\'all make a second season of Young Royals i can live with this look am not a fan of addison but i won’t deny that her acting is great :0 she’s actually pretty good and yes the story line is cliche but it follows the 90s story he’s all that and it’s a very common troupe and story line LMAO at this rate, if Netflix is hiring TikTokers to be actors/actresses, everyone one in the WORLD could become an actor/actress. I’m just saying her acting isn’t as bad as people are saying. She’s not A-lister but this is her debut also I know it’s cliche and cringe but I’m still going to watch it. Coming in with an open mind for Addison Rae, I think she’s cute in this role This is my favorite movie off 2021💖💖 love it so mutch!! Who misses the days when high school movies could be funny, like mean girls or Napoleon Dynamite 😔🤚 Addison looks so cute and beautiful ❤️ I love this movie totally 🥰 if we are gonna talk about bad acting we should take a detour to Miss Kourtny, i dig kourtny very much but the lack of emotions is just to funny😭💀 Okay so I just finished watching it, it\'s not that bad tbh. I am so proud of Addison ❤️ It\'s not a bad movie, it\'s simple just like the original ""She\'s All That"". I think Addison Rae is a good actress in it (she should explore this side of her), despite people talking about TikTok launching her career. The casts are good too. It\'s not a ""deep"" or ""woke"" type of teen-movie, I wish they highlight the social media frenzy generation more because that would explain the cringe worthy prom dance lol. Overall, I say 7/10. Good job. 👍 Crazy how Addison Rae made her way. Congrats Girl!!! Honestly, I am not this type of person who will hate on people but just because you can dance, does that mean you can automatically sing and act too?\n\nA lot of people WORKED for their careers in singing and acting and suddenly we have... This.. I’m disappointed that we’re still making movies like this. Women were always told they weren’t pretty enough if they didn’t wear make up or had a brain. Now the tables have turned and it seems guys aren’t deemed attractive unless they’ve a six pack!\nI expected this in the 90s NOT 2021!! Imagine if the ex boyfriend role was played by Bryce Hall and the mother role by Sherin Easterling 💀 The side characters were my fav characters i love them sm I started to watch this movie thinking this is going to be a cringy ass disaster but not gonna lie, I kinda enjoyed it😊 Omg I lovee that they brought Rachel Leigh back to play Addison\'s mom ppl really took their time to go and watch the whole movie cause it’s trending wth😭😭😭 You know, a girl being beautiful after taking of her glasses  and ponytail is one thing (because why wouldn\'t she be?) but the whole thing where the nerdy, shy guy just happens to have a 6 pack without ever doing a lick of working out is just ridiculous. I find it hard to believe that someone would be meek and shy while also having the body of a Greek god, they just never noticed. This actually look soo good! Can’t wait to see it 😍 If you think about it, this really sucks because there\'re a plethora of gifted actors that would love to have an opportunity like this. It would be fine if Addison was talented, but it\'s unjust that she\'s given all these opportunities when she\'s average at best. It doesn’t look too bad, but people shouldn’t just pick famous people to become actors and actresses, etc. Im happy for Addison! This is awesome. I really enjoyed this film 🤗 She really acted great here! Ima say this now, I preferred “She’s all that” with Freddie Prince Jr, Matthew Lillard, Paul Walker. The Society gets cancelled , and they fund this shit , the world isn\'t fair. Addison’s main goal is looking good,\nShe shows such little emotion.\nNetflix really messing up with these tiktokers huh Addison,hunny i get it People are multitalented but not all are for example me and you.<3 Gotta love trailers who show you the entire movie 😂 I’m gonna watch it with my niece when Netflix drops it because she likes she’s all that and I was little when that came out. This Addison chick’s acting isn’t bad, but I know it’s just the trailer haha this is literally most of the wattpad books ive read The literally gave the whole movie to us in two mins💀 I saw “she’s all that” in the theaters… and is one of my favorite movies… this one is gonna be fun to watch… cobra Kai! 😉 Yes, that’s me on stage as the DJ 😎 her acting is so good oh my god 😍 I still watched it in support of Tanner Buchanan. But I can\'t stop thinking about how the movie would have been better if they cast an actress with experience. Addison had the looks but the way she spoke was so monotonous I didn\'t feel the character\'s emotions. The rest of the cast literally saved the movie for me. OKAAAAAAY, but I really have to say I AM IMPRESSED. Come on guys!!! They act was sooo good !! I didn’t even expect. Goodgoodgood job ! It\'s basically she\'s all like bit reversed. This trailer is the entire movie Right gonna watch ""she\'s all that"" now. Throwback the only reason She’s All That stood out among the sea of 2000s teen movies was because it went deeper than “cool boy falls for uncool girl” it actually fleshed out the two characters beyond their stereotypes and had emotional depth So... the movie ""She\'s all that"" has been parodied almost since the moment it released and for two decades straight but they decided to earnestly remake it beat for beat? There\'s a reason all those parodies have been made. I watched the whole movie in 2 minutes thank you for the amazing promo🤣😂😂🤣🤣 even tho addison as never tried acting before, honestly she did a rlly good job Just saw the entire movie in this trailer and it\'s nothing compared to the original version which was great😔 I didn\'t know Addison was a Tik Toker until after watching this. I think she did a really good job. western movies are just becoming dumber and dumber. the story looks like it\'s written by a 13-year-old wattpad writer. the fact that Netflix cancelled spinning out,the society and I’m not ok with this and are removing the originals to put this on is probably the worst decision they made. Poor Tanner, I\'m so sorry you got dragged into this. Gotta put food on the table I guess 🤷 Good movie, no need to waste 2 hrs when you can watch in 2 mins👌 I’m so excited for this movie I have no Idea what’s gonna happen in it😱 You know what?…I think I now officially miss those movies from the 70s-90s that I always used to think were boring when my parents watched them. Cause…this ain’t it They canceled Anne with an e and so many good series for this Glad that she is able to accomplish so many things. So many people are hating on this girl saying she doesn’t deserve it. Like y’all hating on her and bringing her down isn’t gonna change her position in the media world so it useless .It doesn’t matter life is unfair , she achieved it and is gonna get her cash and live her dream. I wish i was her cause im struggling over here I can tell the whole story by just watching this lol I haven’t watched this but it seems like a good movie I just watched this and it’s brilliant! It explains why they both went on the red carpet together Now explain to me why tf they didn’t just bring back Rachel Leigh Cook as Laney Boggs and made Addison Rae her daughter and made it a continuation of some sort? 🤦\u200d♀️ Instead she’s a completely new character? Two things:\nOne, why is this an actual movie on netflix. \nTwo, do the editors not know what a trailer is? Am I the only one who thinks this actually look so good! I think Addison Rae’s acting in this is fine. Its literally a teen flick. What bothers me is why make this remake in the first place?? The whole makeover trope is lame This was actually worth the watch. I\'m 30 and the original was something I loved as a kid. This version feels like the same cheesey teen movie with heart, just updated for 2021 teens. I actually recommend this. This movie was truly great. Especially the dancing, the final scene and the final song at the end: kiss me. I was going to watch it for fun, but then I watched the whole movie in the trailer. So- Thank you. Are we all gonna ignore the fact that Maddison  Pettis is in here and BEAUTIFUL!!!! Something they should have made a long time ago!!! i don\'t think addison\'s acting is bad, just the fact that she\'s not even an actor but an influencer trying 2 be actor, singer - everything💀 This movie is good enough, Addison\'s acting was nice for a first timer (im not a fan though) and Tanner riding a horse in the end just brought back one of the fairytale feels I totally miss when watching teen romcoms back in the days 🥰 More of this Netflix! 😘 but still She\'s all that is the best ❤️ Still trying to comprehend the fact that Grand Army was cancelled for this İzlerken keyif aldim. Bir tiktore göre güzel oyunculuk. Tebrik ederim SNL already did this in their prom king sketch it’s a lot more heartwarming too I enjoy the movie very much . It\'s pretty good. I can’t wait for Dylan is in trouble to do a commentary on this Okay , but getting the actress from ""she\'s all that"" to play her mum I\'m this movie was actually a really smart power move She really did amazing for her first movie 🙂 Anyone who hates this movie/the concept from the trailer, don\'t watch it. Corporations move where the money is at. If they know we consumers will eat up the most basic sh*t they throw at us, they\'ll keep making that. The only way to ensure we get the kind of effort we want is to put all our support behind things that are actually impactful. They\'re out there but need consumer interest cause that\'s where the money is for me this is a good movie it speaks about what is really happening nowadays wherein there are a lot of teenagers that being bully and people doing vlogs for popularity but it also shows here like what cameron did wherein he did not allowed the bully to turn him down instead he fight back. On the latter part wherein padget learn something that people will love you not because you are popular and for having rich friends but because you are being true to yourself. They look good together and they both have a chemistry. “Look at him! He’s got long hair…a hat…and look at that, he’s got paint on his overalls! What is that?” So they spent millions of dollars remaking a movie with the same exact plot and then gave us a trailer that sums up the entire movie in under 3 minutes.   Well, that was money well spent. Yeah, Mortel better get a season 3 Netflix 😬 but low key this actually looks interesting 🥰 My first thought was, ""she\'s not as bad as dixie at least"" The first one wasn\'t supposed to be a some sort of masterpiece but at least it was an enjoyable to watch. I’m definitely gonna be binging this movie or show i never liked addison rae but this movie is going to be amazing! The fact that there are people that consider tik tok “a career” and end up getting famous because of it for doing nothing makes you think how much the world has gone to shit I\'ll definitely gonna watch this when this finally starts showing.. Addison Rae trying to act heartbroken ""He cheated on me"" with the straightest poker face I have ever seen Why did I put myself through the torture of watching this trailer? Before, I had very few braincells. After this, I have none left. i literally just finished watching geek charming like 5 minutes ago💀😭 It\'s actually a good movie ,im not a fan of Addison but it\'s great 😥💕💕 No cap I\'m actually excited to watch it 💀 I like this it\'s giving me early 2000 movie vibes we all agree that addison probably wasnt the best person they could have casted but at least be proud of her i think she did a great job for her first time by the looks of it Her acting isn\'t that bad for a debut movie,  people were criticizing her so badly that I thought her acting was going to be bad, but it\'s actually decent. Love it😍 Oh my god! Why did it take me so long to realize that the mom is Laney Boggs from She’s all That?! 😲 If you just ignore the bad acting you\'ll find that the movie is actually really good... Remember guys!!!! Apparently if you dance for 1 second! You can become an actor!! Been an actor for twenty two years, it’s rather disheartening to see nepotism and follower count/social clout mean more than years of training. Nothing new I suppose. Idk y everyone’s hating on it but tbh for me it was better than what I expected. I love she’s all that and that’s y I wanted to see this and kinda thought it would be a trash remake but it’s actually not bad at all … It’s a really fun 1 time watch for me and Addison Rae was serious not that bad at acting … ""ugly"" girls with glasses in the 90\'s make overs: got rid off the glasses, got a hair cut and put a thight dress\n\n""ugly"" boys in 2021: take off their shirt. Never been a fan of addison rue but will definitely see this for tanner cuz he’s a cutie ❣️ I liked this movie a lot! Fun way to past the time Best part of this movie was Rachel Leigh Cook hearing Kiss Me playing and going ""something about this song really seems familiar..."" Lol. lets just be honest , she\'s a good actress I love this type of this movies 🔥🙌 Huh. So, Netflix is simply releasing trailers as movies now? That was ok, but kinda predictable. Addison should receive more praise for her accomplishments she may be only person in universe who convinced kourtney to work Oh yay I just watched the whole movie in two and a half minutes. 😀 This movie actually look good tho:) I love it 😍 this literally giving me the “not another teen movie” vibes wth- They literally canceled all the good shows for this.... Wow Addison is an actor I’m definitely watching this I watched the movie yesterday on Netflix with my sister and ngl the movie wasn\'t that bad it was actually really cool 🙂 This movie is probably my favorite movie ever IM SO EXITED!ALL OF EM DID AMAZING! Damn the whole movie finished even before I could get my popcorn ready. We need the society back not this wow. the whole plot in one trailer. thanks netflix. So y\'all cancelled ""Grand Army"" , ""Anne with an E"" and ""the society"" for a movie that we\'ve seen a thousand times?????... Wow! I\'m very surprised. She can act. I dont know I JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH CAMERON OMFG HE\'S SO HANDSOME😭😭😭 I actually really liked the movie not gonna lie 😌\U0001f90c It was nice the the actress who played Laney Boggs came back as the mom....and the jerkface dude came back as the teacher in the dance. But honestly I loved this show because of Tanner ❤ Especially his role in Cobra Kai Moral of the story : don\'t love a girl who shakes the arse and says it dance in tik tok.u have been warned She isnt an awful actress some lines are just a bit unconvincing its just a bit sad how there are so many underrated actors  and just because she has a lot of followers she gets the role , sad 😔😔 Love to see Chubby actress as a teen lead role after long time.. looks natural 😁 Can\'t beat the original ""She\'s All That"" Such a fun film! So I pretty much know the entire plot of the movie after watching the trailer I like how the ""loser"" in the movie is literally every hot Tiktok boy ever I’m not sure how I feel about this yet, being that the original was EVERYTHING when I was in high school, but at least they cast the main character from the first movie ( Rachael Leigh Cook)  to play her mom. I hate tiny cameos and she was the best as her character in the first movie. Highly recommend watching She’s all That before watching this reboot. 🖤 The movie is actually very fine and she wasnt that bad, she was actually good for her first acting role. Omg this looks so good!! I cant wait to watch! Halfway watching this on Netflix and i can\'t take it anymore. The original looks and feels much better! Tbh I think she\'ll be a good like royal family movie thingy idk her voice and the looks goes in that topic more, but she did good for beginner. People need to stop getting mad over someone\'s fame that they themselves gave to it them. Imagine how the people who go to acting school for years must feel about Ms Rae getting a leading role for only her social media following. I would honestly be really upset.\n\nedit: nothing against Ms Rae herself, I was just venting about the injustice of the entertainment industry. ofc she\'ll take the opportunity, we all would. doesn\'t change the fact that it\'s unfair to professional actors. Wow Addison is a pretty good actor We cancelled Grand Army, a show that had deep storytelling potential, to give a budget to this? This just confirms I made the right choice canceling my Netflix account a few months ago until stranger things , ozark and peaky blinders comes back. honestly her acting isn\'t looking that bad in the trailer. & ngl im actually pretty excited to watch this, even tho it\'s like almost every other movie & they told us the whole story lol After All...I really love the character of Tanner, Cameron is really cute This looks like a terrible reboot but I will 100% watch it on a Friday night anyway 😍 It was surprisingly cute film,\nLike a beach read, good junk food\nLike u don\'t have to think much and enjoy it on your pilot mode\nNot bad at all, despite the cliches Addison\'s acting is not that horrible guys. I guess God reveals himself everyday. This could have been good had they used a real actress. Love that they used some of the ordinal cast though. I loved shes all that and now I cant wait to see hes all that ❣ We know the whole movie just by watching the trailer. Thank you netflix for saving my time OH!!!! This is a sequel to “She’s All That!” And Rachel Leigh Cook reprised her role! Despite seeing the entire film in the trailer, once that clicked, I was mind blown. XD This is so bad that it actually goes full circle and becomes good. Seems like Netflix made this movie only for American Tik Tok Audience, cause if they really wanted to make a decent rom-com movie, they would\'ve hired better actors. The best short film I have seen in a while. \n:) The movie they are remaking ""She\'s all that"" is an adult comedy movie with such a classical and original plot yet the remake to that is this, which is unfair to the orginal.\n\nThe only way to redeem this movie is getting the guy to fall for another girl that isn\'t the main girl tbh. I just watched this today and I genuinely loved it !! It was cringe at some parts (The entire Jordan Van Draanan character 🤡/ the dance off) but it had some really funny moments too (the DJ at the dance/the principal dancing/Celeste on stage) Couldn\'t help but notice the unique names in here (Alden/Padgett/Aniston/Brin). It had some great lessons: Kourtney is the main character for me ✨ Just going to go ahead and watch the original “She’s All That” or not another teen movie There is no way.. the director of THE mean girls.. took part in this.. who chose them?! 😭 Probably a typical/clichè movie that I’ll probably end up loving I don’t think the movie looks bad at all, I think we need to give it a chance because none of us have even seen it yet. Also, I don’t blame Addison for wanting to pursue other passion bc tiktok is not going to around forever and she is trying to find something else to grow her career. If you got this opportunity to do a Netflix movie too, you would take it. Pero, ¿cuál será la sorpresa? Siento que ví la peli completa con este trailer. e.e Imagine working your whole life to become an actor/actress to see some clueless tiktoker get the opportunity before you. It’s tragic So, she humiliated herself and broke up with her boyfriend? Really?\n\nAnd literally whole movie was already shown in the trailer. So, I guess I don\'t need to watch the movie Ok it\'s nice, kinda, like every wattpad book I\'ve read, but it\'s still nice, I appreciate the hard work, we can\'t hate them for trying, even though I don\'t like the fact that they canceled some good shows, but still, I like this. I kinda like it I’ll watch it tbh she’s a good actor no cause if Addison actually becomes an “actor” and gets casted for big roles with big ppl I’m gonna give up on life Awesome trailer; now I don’t even need to see the movie! 👍🏾 This has to be one of the most disastrous trailers I have ever seen. i have netflix and i got to see it. it was so good Welcome to new world guys !!!\n Now, no need to have talent and make efforts to be a professional dancer, a singer, a professional makeup artist or even an actor ! Be famous by doing unnecessary videos, you will be an influencer and you will have all of it !\n Sad for people who actually have talent and work very hard to achieve their dream but are pushed aside !!!! So goood and funny, it was like a book I could not put down. Instead of relax-and-watch-a-movie-for-30-mins-b4-bedtime, I stayed up and watched every minute till the end with utter glee. Teenage USA PROM class are scary FIERCE & HUGE FUN!  And that was some DROP FITZGERALD GATSBY PARTY??!!😀😀💖💖⭐⭐⭐⭐🍾💝💖🍻🥂🍷⭐⭐⭐⭐💖💖😀😀💖💖⭐⭐⭐⭐🍾💝💖🍻🥂🍷⭐⭐⭐⭐💖💖😀😀💖💖⭐⭐⭐⭐🍾💝💖🍻🥂🍷⭐⭐⭐⭐💖💖😀😀💖💖⭐⭐⭐⭐🍾💝💖🍻🥂🍷⭐⭐⭐⭐💖💖😀😀💖💖⭐⭐⭐⭐🍾💝💖🍻🥂🍷⭐⭐⭐⭐💖💖😀😀💖💖⭐⭐⭐⭐🍾💝💖🍻🥂🍷⭐⭐⭐⭐💖💖😀😀💖💖⭐⭐⭐⭐🍾💝💖🍻🥂🍷⭐⭐⭐⭐ Let me summarise the entire film right now:\nAddison is a high school princess who is really popular. She catches her boyfriend cheating, so after her friends bet, she decides to make a little project by making the ‘weirdest’ boy in school into prom king. She tries to seduce him in “comedic” ways and makes a fool of herself. She gives him a makeover and he becomes “hot”. Then she realises that she likes him and they start going out. However, she starts falling out with her friends, and the boy finds out and storms off. Cue Addison having a ‘break down’ scene and the mom gives her many words of wisdom. Then she goes to prom alone and guess who shows up, you guessed it, the makeover boy and she realises that she likes him for who he really is. They kiss and it’s happily ever after. The end. I was actually paralyzed from the waist down but after watching this, I was finally able to get up and throw myself out the window. Tanner Buchannan has appeared in many spin offs, sequels, whatever you want to call it:\nGirl Meets World- Boy Meets World\nFuller House- Full House\nCobra Kai- Karate Kid I watched it and I actually really liked it. Stop hating guy!! I mean... if you’ve already watched “She’s All That” then you basically know how this goes...even if you didn’t watch the trailer. Same thing, just gender reversed. THAT MOVIE WAS SO GOOD I WATCHED IT WHILE I WAS ON A ROAD TRIP AND I DONT EVEN LIKE Addison THAT MUCH not to be rude this doesn\'t look too bad at first glance, it\'s just a present day remake of an iconic movie Love it cant wait to wach it Let me get this straight, netflix remakes a movie, gender swapps the characters, integrate cringy social media business, casts a tiktoker instead of a good actress like idk Peyton List for example and makes a trailer that spoils the entire movie plot. Why? I’ve seen what happens when you cast tiktokers and it’s not good. Attaway general is proof of that. Come on netflix, you’re better than this. I don\'t think Addison will live because of Tory😂😂😂 As long as y\'all make a third season of \'You\' I\'m okay with this YALL ARE JUST HATING! IT\'S ACTUALLY GOOD🙌🏾🙌🏾 At first I though maybe this a sequel about her daughter but then I looked it up on imdb and found out she\'s playing a completely different character. Personally, they should have just made it a sequel since Rachel Leigh-Cook is in it. I see so many people saying it\'s a remake of this or that film without even realizing that they are all actually based on ""Pygmalion"" by George Bernard Shaw. I keep remembering the old highschool movies from the 90\'s and 2000s She has literally no experience in acting but gets her own movie all because she\'s conventionally attractive. Yeah sounds like pretty privilege to me. 🙄 every jealous Addison hater would have excepted the role had they offered it to you, experienced or not! Shouldn\'t hate anyone for capitalizing on an opportunity! She\'s marketable as hell! Translation: CHA-CHING!! Not bad… can’t wait to watch it 🤓 I’ll watch this, I’ll just ignore the fact that it’s Addison. I like movies like this lol just watching 2 minutes of it feels like 20 hours I have no intention of watching this movie, but to all the criticizers: why do you not say the same for the numerous actors and actresses that are the child of an already famous director, actor, producer, etc.? You can be sure they all got a few roles because of their parents. shows like the society and grand army get cancelled and instead we get these corny movies with the same plot Thanks the trailer just saved me an hour of the movie Here I was thinking JYPE’ trailers are bad, but this just makes them look better. \n\nBorahae 💜 This is also like ""Geek Charming""\nRemember that movie? How old. The woman who played Padgett’s mother played Laney in “She’s all that.”  However, I am surprised Freddie Prinze Jr didn’t make a cameo appearance as well. I know I get that Addison doesn’t deserve this role but I did enjoy the movie lol Okay but can we talk about how Laney from she’s all that aka Rachael Leigh Cook looks amazing and hasn’t aged at all 👏🏼 THE TRAILER GAVE THE WHOLE PLOT AWAY they really didn\'t have to remake a perfectly good 90\'s movie. But.......He is so beautiful and moving!❤️🤧\nHe is really the boy of dreams! And what we all want is a boy who loves us from our soul and not from our appearance! This will be the greatest gift we could have in our whole life! And if we look for him we will find him!❤️ It\'s already a classic. she doesnt deserve this hatred..hey addison .. i really mean it when i say that u really have a hidden talent.. So many remakes. There’s definitely a lack of creativity and imagination in the industry. Besides that, hopefully the new generation will enjoy this. Give the original a watch too. An oscar for this? For this!! This would be good if the main actress could actually act I love watching a whole movie in 2 min For this being her first time acting I think she’s doing pretty good? basically like every other school teen movie ok but all jokes aside. This looks so gooodddd! Does any teenager actually dress in real life or act like this? So I just need to be a damn huge tiktoker to be an “actress” this is literally the exact plot line of geek charming Omg I’m so excited to watch it Mindhunter: gets cancelled\nThe Society: gets cancelled\nthis ""thing"": exists and funded Guys- if you don\'t take it too seriously, this movie is actually really cute. Obviously it wont win any awards, but Addisons performance wasn\'t terrible and it had a really cute ending. Well, lessons learned guys, all you have to do to make a guy look good, is to give him a haircut. The shows that they cancelled to make this just astounds me I just finished watching it. And as expected, I didn\'t expect much LOL I have never heard of this actress who played the main lead. But she wasn\'t very good in it. I don\'t know why they remade this. I loved the first one. I\'m glad that Rachael Leigh Cook and Matthew Lillard were in this, but they didn\'t even play the same characters from the original. I gave this video a thumbs down. There was no need to remake this movie. I understand that a lot of people liked this movie, but to each his own.  I need to go back and watch the first one just to get this one out of my mind LOL. Everyone is entitled to their opinion after all :) Lemme get this straight. You canceled.. On my Block and Atypical.. for this mediocre movie? Wow. Wow, just wow. Dan that movie was soooo good😝😝❤️❤️❤️love all the spoilers! So, essentially there was a meeting to brainstorm new movie ideas and after hours of failure someone just says :\n\n“You know what would be mind blowing? ‘She’s All That’ but with social media and a boy getting a makeover.” Definitely not regretting my decision to cut Netflix. The fact that they made Jordan look like  Bryce hall is killing me😃 This is like the entire movie I can already tell you the end without watching it she needs up falling in love with him he finds out he was a deal they get In a fight then she forgive her and they end happil ever after the end It\'s pretty cool how they\'ve honoured the original by keeping the song and having Rachael Leigh Cook play the mother. I bet there are loads of other tributes to the original throughout! Seriously Netflix? We didn’t need a tiktok flavored remake! Also they just gave us the entire movie plot…. Well that’s the whole movie watched so saves me a couple of hours! Addison Rae is so amazing. love your acting This was such a cute lil movie 🍿 Pov: you\'re watched the movie in 2 minutes and the 27 seconds are the credits Nobody:\n\nKourtney: “he’s cUTE??” Robby Keene is going to more mad at Padgett than he is with his dad Johnny Lawrence. But I love Addison tho 😭❤️ addison rae fans: this is sooooooooooooooooo good 😊 Ok but jokes aside I will actually watch this and probably enjoy it. It seems like a pretty interesting movie. Honestly I’ve been complaining for nearly 2 years now about why there’s no montages of men improving themselves besides like Rocky and the 40 year old virgin. Based on the principle alone I stan. This literally looks a Disney movie I’m surprised I haven’t seen anyone talk about the fact that this is a remake of she’s all that Even though this looks terrible and corny, Addison is doing a good job all things considered. I was expecting worse. Thanks for summarising the whole movie in 2:30 minutes Netflix you really are the best thankfully now I don’t have to waste 1 hour to learn that this movies is bad I already just learned it from watching this trailer hahaha It wasn\'t so bad. Cameron was cute af 🥰 basically:\n\npagdet (addi) was humiliated and always called bubble girl and one of her best friends was Jessica (kourtney Kardashian)  and her friends go to  Well I think Netflix was pretty smart. They casted her because of her follower count and knew it would garner attention. Tbh, I think this girl is clever for capitalizing on this. \n\nHate the game not the player. Though, I do think she’s just another pretty face with not that much to go off of other than her looks. The trailer is the whole movie 😂😂😂🤷🏻\u200d♂️ RENEW “ANNIE WITH AN E” AND “THE SOCIETY” , they really traded those actually enjoyable and watchable shows for all of this teen nonsense movie that it’s literally just the flipped version from the 90’s og one  😃????😭 Omg! Tanner\'s body is crazy when he shows himself shirtless. 😍😍 The acting, bestie. I cant- why does it feel like a one hour long movie I was interested in watching the movie until they got to the makeover scene. I really like the guy character with long hair and I thought maybe Addison\'s character might learn a thing or two about popularity. Nope, the plot was thrown out because of the makeover scene. I just unsubscribed Netflix just for this movie❤️ Internet: “This movie ain’t sh*t” \n\nNetflix: Top 10  Oh Gosh, Tanner in the beginning! “He doesn’t want to stare at the🙊🙊😂” saved so much money watching some of these trailers because they explain the whole movie ""09:02"" We got everything we needed with 𝐈𝐍𝐉𝐀𝐏𝐏 this actually looks decent… Everyone complaining about Addison Rae but the Cobra kid acting is abismal too This is literally just a gender flip of ‘not another teen movie’.  Real original 😏 Unpopular Opinion:This is 10x better than the whole Kissing Booth trilogy. Addison did fine for her 1st role. this was literally the whole movie?? wow way to play a whole movie in just 2 minutes 💀 I just use wanted to say I don’t view her (Addison) as a serious actor for a romcom movie I just view her only for tiktok stuff if anything. I do believe they should’ve  pick a real actor to play a role like this especially if it’s somewhat of a remake. I’ve been laughing FOR THIRTY MINUTES Thanks for the whole pointless movie ❤️ shown in 2 mins I can’t believe manifest was cancelled for this! I genuinely don\'t know how i feel about this one, lemme me get back to you on this The remix of ""Kiss Me"" is like adding salt to the wound. The stiff facial expressions are killing me 🤣🤣😂😂 This was a great 2 minutes and 28 second movie in the movie i was shocked when i heard\nBrent Rivera\'s name 😂😂 i bet, this movie will make addison more iconic. Okay but I know the entire plot and the reveal now lol These are all gorgeous young people, and I can\'t feel a single thing for any of them. While everyone’s hating on this movie before it even came out, I for one am excited! bro im seeing an oscar ❤️❤️ Yes, let\'s make already a good looking guy better looking..so realistic lmao. At least Rachel Leigh Cook actually looked like a typical school nerd. It actually looks good. THE MOVIE WAS GOOD ASF, STPP JUDGING ADDISON\'S ACTING 😞😍 Robby been real different after getting training with kreese As a millennial that grew up in the 90s this just makes us feel so OLD lmao now Rachel Leigh Cook is the mom, Oh God they going probably remake Clueless next.  I hate this! lol So you mean to tell me there\'s struggling, yet talented actors all over LA and the globe who just need a shot- but you decided to go with Addison Rae as a headlining actor? I’ve watched it. It’s totally a movie from 2000s but with today’s technology/social media. Quite enjoyable tho. But this trailer literally shows everything 😅 I’ve watched it. It’s totally a movie from 2000s but with today’s technology/social media. Quite enjoyable tho. But this trailer literally shows everything 😅 watching the film now and gonna see how far i get through it (i’m bored ok T-T) omg just finished watching, dude its actually really good This whole thing could have been avoided and we could have saved our braincells from watching this if the one chicks friend was like... a decent person and turned the video off the moment they walked in and saw he was cheating. so who gave off the idea of tik tokers having acting talent and needing MORE attention? Wow thank you for the WHOLE movie! To be honest addisons acting was way better than i thought it was gonna be Oh my God they\'re still making movies like this. I was born in the 80s and they\'re still making this s*** Remaking another movie great we needed that again The movie wasn’t even that bad, and addison did a good job 👍🏾 y’all just love to hate her while she is doing her thing Tanner Buchanan cannot be made unattractive no matter how many ""glow downs"" you do. I swear I’ve seen this EXACT plot somewhere Tanner went from a bad ass in cobra kai to this... IM DEAD!! HAHAHAH The fact that the director of mean girls directed this movie💀 lmao Netflix don\'t know what to do anymore. You can\'t make a remake of ""he\'s all that"" now that "" Not Another Teen Movie"" exists XD It\'s just impossible to take that plot seriously anymore Netflix: Hey Addison, wanna act in a movie \nAddison: But I\'m not an actor\nNetflix: Pfft you\'re famous, people won\'t mind not gonna lie but this is much better acting than I expected from Addison and the cast seems pretty cool especially with characters from the original providing cameos So no one seems to know that this is a remake of a 90’s movie called She’s All That. It’s one of those so bad it’s good movies, but that works because everything was cheesy and stupid in the 90’s. Not to mention, the acting was actually pretty good and it had its nice moments. Despite some clichés, it’s become a beloved cult classic. This does not look like it will be any of those things. Rachel-Leigh Cook being in this movie, is the best thing about this movie! Rachael Leigh Cook!! I wonder if she will reprise her role as Laney. she’s actually good at acting Unpopular opinion: the movie actually wasn\'t that bad Gave us the entire movie in the trailer 👍 It is not as bad as people have been painting it to be. It just a simple highschool movie. The acting is just perfect for it though Ngl if there was better acting and maybe Addison Rae wasn’t the main character I would’ve liked the movie A moment of silence for the actors & actresses who have been waiting years/investing time & money to get there big break. Whilst Netflix is giving people roles because. Tiktok ok i\'m not really a huge fan on how she got this role and the movie plot itself but i can say that her acting\'s kinda better than dixie\'s. though i hate comparing but yk. This is literally geek charming Bruh!!! Everyone\'s acting is better than Addison\'s!! 😐😬 OMGGGG i am soo frickin excited!! Addison is our princess and Charli da queen!! And da Kardashiansss I miss the 90’s!!!! But this movie was good too. I’m saddened at all the impactful and quality shows netflix has been effing cancelling just for them to come out with mediocre movies. Cancelled my subscription Lucas and Jeremy really hate each other. They’re on opposite ends in everything they act in 😂 damn can i be an actor too? its been one of my dreams for like ever Hands down awesome!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 puts kdrama to shame. That was filmed at my old high school, Pali high in Pacific Palisades! So weird because I was a currentl student there when She\'s all that came out! I feel like I’m watching something I would make lmao This is the Family Guy episode where Connie turns Chris into the cool guy. I\'m an actress and I\'ve studied acting for five years, I\'m working my ass off to get even a tiny role in a play or a movie and this just doesn\'t feel right...\nBeing an actor is not easy and it takes a lot to become one... The viewers of ""She\'s all that"" will understand the nostalgia..especially the SONG man 🥺❤❤ This actually looks good .. YESSSS! another heterosexual highschool romance with an entirely white and skinny cast! and the kardashians! so original! can\'t wait :) I really hope they don\'t one day remake this movie or make a spoof of it...oh, wait...🤨 not as bad as i thought it was going to be . Something i would actually watch not joking. The movie was actually good would definitely watch it again I\'ll never forget Addison, ""Korean is not an Asian."" This movie was cute actually I don’t follow Addison Ray or however but I think she portrayed a real sweetheart. Yes it’s a movie of course they’re going to have unrealistic expectations of having models for the film. Kourtney’s voice crack LMFAO I can’t 💀 THE FACT THAT THIS STORYLINE WAS A GACHA MINI MOVIE TREND YEARS AGO- 💀💀 0:08 isn\'t this a common scene? Like I literally seen this kind of scene in every RomCom movies/series lmao. so she picks the ""nerd"" at the end, but it\'s still a good-looking guy. \n\nIf the genders were reversed, I have a strong feeling the feminists would be very uppity about that. Double standards :-) I’ve watched Cobra Kai and in that Tanners acting is amazing, almost seems like in this he’s had to make his acting worse just so Addison looks likes she actually knows what she doing 😂 ngl It looks pretty good I actually want to the movie wasn’t actually bad 😂 actually shipped addison & the new guy From the director of ""Mean Girls"" wow what a glow down.. netflix really gave us the whole movie and the spoilers in one trailer, nice Thank you for giving me trust issues😍 Ok, but has no one seen She\'s all That? Rachel leigh cook is literally the mom and this is literally the same movie but reversed roles and more modern, I lowkey like that they added her in this, but I think there could have been some better changes to this movie as well. Major throwback moments to the good days, can’t wait!!! NETFLIX STOP MAKING TRAILERS THAT SPOIL EVERYTHING ANYWAYS I\'M EXCITED Bro this looks so good I personally think Madison Pettis should’ve been the main character Wait, I\'ve just watched the whole movie. Thank you netflix trailer Y\'all are accusing & hating Addison for being popular but the fact is we,the normal people,made her popular. And btw she is doing something worthwhile apart from Tiktok which is really appreciable. Love it 😍 Addisons acting isn’t horrendous but I wouldn’t want to see her acting in anymore movies cause it’s not to great either yk? This is LITERALLY exactly like ""She\'s All That""movie: Just that instead of the guy getting heartbroken it\'s the girl (Addison Rae)\n\n(school jock Zach is dumped by his queen-bee girlfriend, he makes a bet with his friends to take geeky Laney and make her prom queen. What he did not bet on was falling in love with her.) Okay so I’m currently watching the movie and it’s not as bad as I thought ngl Actually... The movie is somewhat a sequel to ""She\'s All That""- loved that movie so much. But this... Idk.... We\'ve already had 3 movies with the SAME plot and now another. The trailer is literally the movie Why? Simply why?\n\nTHE LAUGH THAT CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH WHEN I SAW KOURTNEY WAS HORRENDOUS💀😭🤚🏼 WHATTTTTTTT???!?!?? ADDISON SLAYED HERE, SUCH A GOOD POTENTIAL Y\'all cant just be happy for someone? Addison has trained in acting and wanted a career in acting, singing etc. She seems to have worked hard and her socials have just boosted her to get to this place... times are changing people, get on board or at the very least stop spreading negativity! The whole movie is in the trailer tho- This is the perfect example of Modern Society where looks/popularity overshine talent in a talent industry. 0:06 \n\n\n’wE’rE oVeR oK’  Tbh Addison’s acting is pretty decent for her first movie Are people really upset at this trailer for spoiling the movie? It\'s a literal remake. It\'s designed to follow the exact same storyline as the original. It should be common knowledge what happens, with or without a trailer. I also don\'t get why people are using the fact that their tv show was canceled to hate on this movie.  Apart from the fact that many things can lead to a good tv series being canceled, it should not be forgotten that Netflix is a global business and not a charity. When people choose to borrow passwords instead of pay for the service, then they have to cut their losses and make the things that sell. The losses will inevitably include shows that are highly popular in your region, but whose ratings are low globally. Likewise, the bankable things include teen movies, with low production cost and high watchability. It doesn\'t matter if people watch it because they\'re bored, or genuinely like it, or just want to hate on it. Once it pulls views; it\'s worth it. This factor might not sit well with you, but you still shouldn\'t hate on the movie because of that, especially without giving it a chance. I watched it and was pleasantly surprised by the high level of savagery and sarcasm it contained. It also sent a good message to youths and encouraged them to actually enjoy life rather than create a facade for the sake of views. Modernizing the story by pairing a clout-obsessed influencer with a loner who hates social media is a concept that could work on paper. But it just comes off looking extremely generic. IT LOOKS SO GOOD I swear if this movie doesn\'t have a spontaneous dance scene with USher as a DJ I dont want it Ignoring Addison for a moment…WHY DID MY MOUTH HANG OPEN WHEN I SAW THE GUY’S TRANSFORMATION 😭😭😱 You didn’t think this was better than the original, did you? Oh, you did. That’s so sweet 😂 I\'m a fan of her after watching this movie😭 Hoenstly seeing people say that her acting doesn\'t look that bad just proves how little people know about acting 😬 I’m actually pretty excited about this movie, looks super fun. Everyone’s complaining how Addison was a Tik Tok star and has no acting experience, but look at Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, they were models / inexperienced actors before they were cast, and we all love them now. Nothing is different here. If anyone was in Addison’s shoes, they would have totally taken advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity. My rationale is… Don’t hate on the players of the game. If anyone’s gonna be mad, then blame the game and the nepotism in society, which set these standards in the first place. I bet the reason so many good shows left was for.. this So are we supposed to think that she can act? Atleast they revealed the entire plot here so people won\'t actually have to watch it 🍷 I don’t even need to watch the movie I just aw the entire thing in two minutes Her mom looks like a sister still a beauty from “She’s all that” It’s nice to see Addison Rae having her inner talent unleashed !! Addison Rae is so freaking beautiful 🥺✨💯 ""You\'re still live"" - Girl who is literally holding the phone I grew up believing all American high schoolers looked like 20 something year old models. Now that I\'m older.... I still think that lol Damn! It’s was year 1999 when I watched SHES ALL THAT  im getting old😏 I totally prefer the 90s version like is a classic, this one just looks like the rest of the modern movies :( After watching this, I then googled for more picture. OK, Tanner just made my miserable late 20s sad single ass melted with his sweet innocent eyes. Hope I don\'t sound creepy and Addison Rae is beautiful by the way. soooo many books have this plot especially if yall read wattpad yall will understand - Whole story of the movie right there lol. Should have at least kept the big reveal a secret They just couldn\'t leave She\'s all that alone... It\'s an iconic 90s movie by itself.. We don\'t a silly remake with influencers.. i love how bad this movie is\n\ni cant wait how bad this is going to be The movie was actually good!\nYou shouldn\'t not watch it just because of people reviews.. watch it and judge it for yourself everyone got different taste. I just finished the movie and I thought it was cute. y’all over doing it this doesn’t even seem bad 😂 and for addisons fist roll seem like she did a decent job This movie looks like an attempt to make an indoctrinated lifestyle focused around following the algorithm seem normal and not how insane it actually is and usually appears to people on the outside omg this is such a new concept. I didn\'t mind this movie :) To imagine living in times seeing actors make believe with their core acting skills like,  Daniel d Lewis, Geoffrey rush, Seymour Hoffman, Joaquin phoenix, Ian McCallum, Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Jim Carrey, Charlize Theron, viola Davis, danzel Washington and many others, it has come up to days when such actors are casted in movies. I just realized the woman who played padgetts mom starred in shes all that as laney boggs 😂 This seems like an Awesomeness TV trailer in what universe would a guy with model looks and rippling abs be ""the school’s biggest loser"" I mean Addison\'s Acting is actually pretty good hopefully it\'s not all too bad 0:33 We got everything we needed with 𝗜𝗡𝗝𝗔𝗣𝗣 the only thing i could think about during this entire sh!t show was that they’re at beacon hills high school 😭 the only reason i watched it is cause of my teen wolf withdrawal How could the director of Mean Girls go from Mean Girls to THIS They are disrespecting ""She\'s all that""😠 the original movie. How dare they It makes me feel very sad that a film I saw in high school is now considered a ""teen classic"" - cue that GIF of Matt Damon turning into an old man. People are saying there is no point in watching the movie now. But I recommend you do watch it. It\'s so touching. I just saw it yesterday, it\'s amazing! It\'s a powerful movie. It\'s full of emotions!\nTo all you guys saying that the trailer spoiled it, you\'re wrong. there\'s more to the story then you know! ""he told me i\'ll be fine...""\n\n""Who told you?"" My favorite part is when Jennifer Gardner is giving the speech at her church and shows how the little things we take for granted makes everything possible, like the receptionist at the hospital talking to the doctor, Angela taking her day off from work to hang out with them, or the airline guy giving them the flight tickets.  Truth is that the spirit of God is within every single one of us, and when you do something good for someone else, you are helping God create a miracle in someone\'s life!!! Cried a lot watching this movie. One of my faves. This was one of the Christian movies that made me cry so much I can’t stop crying when I watch this For those people saying the trailer ""ruined"" the ending of the movie, this was national news a while back. Everybody pretty much knows what happened. So this movie isn\'t about plot twists or anything like that. It\'s not about the beginning or the end. It\'s about the journey. This movie was so good! It touched my heart and my soul :) Jesus does exist 🙏and the part were she mention ""he told me that I will be fine"" truly made me cry because Jesus saved her. This movie will reminds you that God is always beside you ang listening to you 😢😭🙏 she totally deserved an Oscar for this! I saw this movie years ago, and it\'s still my favorite movie to this day. it\'s so touching. and for people who are saying that the trailer spoiled it all, no it didn\'t. there\'s so much more to the movie. I love this movie and i\'m watching it right now❤️❤️. this is not a trailer! this is the movie! it showed everything! I just want to say that I watch this movie and it touched me and moved me. So many of us who have children never stop to think how lucky we are to have healthy and happy kids. When we see our children having a good day rather it being playing with other friends, soccer, entertainment, etc. stop and say a silent prey in your head thanking Jesus for dying on the cross and giving us all life and our healthy child\'s life and then pray for those who aren\'t so lucky that some how they will find God and peace. We have a Great God who is loving and merciful and although we may not understand why things happen the way they do, know that God has a plan and his plans are always for good. Through this little girl\'s illness and then her testimony and miracle healing, this movie was created. So that many others who perhaps don\'t know Jesus will come to find him and those who do know him will come to realize just how fortunate they are to have him in there life.  I just finished the movie... I cried, this story is beautiful. I praise God for the  awesome miracle that was performed on the family and portrayed on the film. 💖 I just finished watching it again for the 3rd time and i still burst in to tears. the story, the kindness of random people around them is just amazing ❤ I cried throughout the movie. And I still do... 😭😭😭😭 Such a great movie and story!!💜💜💜💜 \'\'He told me I\'ll be fine \'\'\nNever cried so much over a line.... 😭😭😭 I guess we don\'t need to watch a full movie, don\'t we? Watched this movie yesterday and it was great as expected. I cried for almost the whole movie. Try to watch it first you\'ll see something more. This movie reminds me of what God can do in our life if we keep believing. That\'s what faith can do. I highly recommend watching this movie! It is such a beautiful film. I cried sooo muchhh :\') mostly for good reasons. LOVED every bit of this movie. perfect acting. I love this movie it\'s so heart warming and the fact that it\'s based on a real story makes it better Maravilhoso esse filme é uma história real, me emocionei bastante This make me cry for a three time 😔 Esse filme é maravilhoso, eu assisti e me emocionei I watched this when I was depressed and it give me  an immense faith in Jesus I got shivers y’all I saw an ad and when she fell down and when her mother said God give me a sign she fell nothing broke but healed her and the song made it sad again and the part “he told me I will be fine” got me goosebumps I just finished watching the movie just now. It strengthens my faith in God. It moved me. I cried at the part where Jen told the nurses that her daughter was healed. I just watched it 5 minutes ago and this is the first and only movie that made me cry around 4 times 🙁🙁🙁🙁.\nI\'m very happy that my little girl is healthy thank you God. 3 years later and I still recommend watching it. I cried 3 times I saw it last night, and I loved it! Such beautiful films with such a positive message are rare nowadays. One of the best movies Of 2016! História emocionante, de arrepiar! \nDeus é maravilhoso e extraordinário, o seu amor não falha! ❤ For everyone saying the trailer spoiled the whole thing, it\'s based on a true story so it was already spoiled back when it happened. :) god bless you all I just saw this movie for the first time tonight at church. It is a gut-wrenching and ultimately triumphant masterpiece. And the cast was top notch. Everything about the flick was well-done. I got choked-up from both heartache and joy more than just a few times. It was beyond awesome. You feel sad watching the trailer but watching the whole movie you CRY. Honestly y’all have to watch it! It’s soooooo goooood! 😭😍 I watched this movie when I was 8. I was with my grandmother and we sat there and cried together. This movie is so touching. I looked and have been looking for this movie for years now and finally found it. Thank you YouTube. 🦋 I have this DVD at home and literally watch this over and over again 💜 This movie touched my heart, I really recommend it. ❤️ It’s has the happiest ending, I love it ❤️ Jesus is a miracle from heaven I have seen this film before. I can\'t stop watching it! It\'s such a powerful film with tonnes of tense moments. I just love it. I\'m not very religious however this film was so good everyone should watch it. It made me cry! I watched this movie, I can tell you that it’s worth watching and that it’s one of the best movies I’ve ever watched, like the marvel and Star Wars movies, but it’s own genre and I can tell you it’s just as good, so unpredictable, and what happens is truly a miracle I\'ve watched the whole movie with my family. It\'s so emotional and in the end, it is really a Miracle. I watched this movie in 2019 August, I’m a pastor son but now I even believe more in miracles ✞ Filme lindo!🙏💫 When I watched this movie years ago...I’ve literally never cried so much 😭😭😭\nIt always helps me remember that god is ALWAYS working even when we think he’s not ❤️ I’ve just watched this movie and i really recommend it. It’s very heart touching and hopeful. It’s beautiful. Have just finished watching this movie & of course at times it\'s very moving.\nThe cast played their parts brilliantly.\nI knew what was going to happen as soon as Anna fell inside the tree, & yes it was a miracle.\nWish miracles like that were more plentiful...but happy for this  young lady & her loving family that she is doing well. I truly thank God for this movie. This movie really blessed me and ministered to me tremendously in this season. God knows I needed to see this. All of the children in the movie was really cute, and they did a phenomenal job. The little girls faith, wisdom, knowledge, and understanding in God really blessed me. I hate that she suffered, but I\'m glad that her story have been a blessing to people all over the world. I have to say that this is by far one of the best movies i watched... I cried, i laughed, i prayed i believed.   Movie has so much more than the trailer reveals... Every small scene in this movie gives something special to the whole thing. Would recomend to everyone I just watched the movie and it was beautiful! I agree with the fact that if you watch the trailer you\'ll know the whole plot and mostly what happens however there happens SO MUCH MORE in this movie. The emotion I have felt in this movie I haven\'t felt in years while watching a movie. It was so beautiful down and you could just feel the pain from everyone. Movie which made me cried from first to last and the sentence Miracle is in every day made me believe in miracles .... I would highly recommend this movie to everyone ❤ Man I was feeling suicidal until I watched this beautiful movie ❤️ I watched this movie with my mom and family. It was a good movie and I give it 5 stars for being so creative and making me cry😭. It was a touching movie of how she survived all that and how the family came closer... I\'ve watched this movie and this is literally THE BEST! i cried 10000000x times! will show u that God is amazing! 💖 The FULL movie was on TV this morning. I just happened to watch it and was able to watch the entire full move. It is such a wonderful film in cinematography, acting, complete story line with the ""actual"" participants of the miracle introduced in the final footage of the film. Worth experiencing for yourself and sharing with others. Not everyone on earth is fortunate enough to experience miracles, but those that do it is beyond words and involves feelings. I remember watching this movie for the first time with my mom, that\'s the first time I\'ve ever screamed out crying from a movie this movie made me realize 3 things; how great a mother\'s love is, how faith works and miracles happen if we believe. I watched this movie like a million times and I keep crying! Now I wanna watch it again! Loved this movie!!!! This is such beautiful movie.  Even watching this trailer makes me tear up. When I first watched the trailer a few months ago, I got interested. When the movie came out, I was desperate to watch it. So I did, and I cried so much, it was so good. In my opinion of course. The best movie ever...\nReally touching story, very good acting game, all of them played so amazing.. My eyes were wet during the whole film..\nGod exsist and he hear us 🙏🙏🙏\nI hope that the family is good now ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Me and my husband watched this with our 3 kids one night for family movie night. It had me and my husband bawling our eyes out. My oldest son couldn’t finish watching it, because it bothered him seeing that little girl go through all that pain. This is such a good movie, very touching. This is based on a true story. You can find the news article online talking about her falling into the 30 foot tree. Jesus is real!! Saw the movie today.  It was amazing.  A heart warming story that proves God does exist and miracles do happen. I cried more on this movie then I\'ve ever cried in my entire life. Waterfalls were pouring out my eyes. Incredible movie. Cried so much. I love this movie so much its so heart touching it made me cry so bad definitely recommend it🙂 this trailer is almost as epic as the movie was. it still gives me chills Lindo filme ,e nós mostra que a Fé é tudo . Still watch it this movie is very touching and inspiring I cried consistently during it. This stuff is real and it touches my heart so much.❤️😭 Loved every bit of this movie . Cried my eyes out . God works in mysterious ways :) It\'s fantastic, I watch it and it was the best 2 hours of my life. It\'s so emotional and it let me to cry several time it\'s so true and it feels you as if you were there with the characters😞❤ When I lost belief  in everything I still remind this movie.It has a huge impact on my life...😍😍😍\nThe name was forgotten by me for a lone time ....Thank god now I can watch it again...🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Amei esse filme maravilhoso, Glória a Deus 🙏🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 i saw this movie a while ago and i was so amazed! me and my family belives in god and this movie really made me get the goose bumps. i kinda felt like god was close to me while i was watching this. i still remember it to this day! I’ve met Anna before I wasn’t allowed to talk to her but her mother is super nice! Even the trailer still makes me cry!! Watched this movie, strongly recommended, I cried many times, so deep :)\nLook around, miracles are everywhere! i just watched this movie this made me cry alot , definetly one of my faves. Such a great movie. I cried when I watched this. My sister had something similar to this. I\'ve watched this movie during Quarantine, and it made myself cry. Because this is such a  beautiful story. I highly recommended this Last part always get me the chills and tears of joy 2:11  love you Jesus   ❤️❤️❤️ Great movie! Watched the whole thing a few days ago! Really well done! Two ways to look at life: That-nothing is a miracle....or that Everything is a miracle. This is the most beautiful movie I saw in my life ..whenever my problems of life push me down in life ..I watch this movie as a reminder that leap of faith is the most important thing in life and our eyes are closed to the blessings in the form of right ppl placed at the right time . We can\'t stop praying and be angry with god during our hardships.  After these hardships the biggest miracles happen in our lives that we cant imagine of. Also we all talk to god and feel god it\'s TRUE! to everyone who is reading this just remember that you are beautiful and that you are loved and don\'t change your self for anyone else and what ever you are going through you aren\'t alone I\'m so glad that I didnt watch the trailer before seeing the movie! It\'s such a good movie and I wouldnt have been as invested knowing she got healed at the end. This is literally the saddest movie I’ve ever watched especially the ending but overall I loved it The best choice I made tonight was to watch this movie with my husband. We both were so touch by this story. And we were surprised it was a true story. God is good and he is alive! This movie was so good! It touched my heart and my soul :) The trailer told me everything, I still watched it and still sobbed my eyes out this was a beautiful movie I cried at the end. I cried so much in this movie! It’s so touching❤️ I\'ve watched the movie and it is one of the best movie I\'ve ever watched!I\'ve never cried that much watching a movie! Muito lindo esse filme   fiquei impressionada Absolute  gem of a movie miracles really do happen I actually cried it got to me watch this movie and you will believe  anything is possible based on a true story fantastic I gave this a massive thumbs up 👏 Man you have no idea how much this movie made me and my mom cried so much. There are is many miracles god has done and He is great and truly amazing This movie Made me cry  😭 always remember that We are not alone, God is always with us 🙏 I was in tears watching the ending part of this movie. I just  L O V E  this movie. I\'ve always been confused on what I believe. I\'m not sure what I believe but what happend to this girl is amazing and a miracle xx This looks like a great comedy can\'t wait to watch it! that part when they fell out of the tree was comedy gold The best movie ever ❤️ makes you feel like everything will be ok 👍 It was probably a full year after the movie first premiered that people in my life would bring up this movie or asking if I\'d found an old hollowed out tree to fall into yet. \nNot only was this a good movie but it brought awareness and started conversations. 😍 I loved this trailer.\nThis movie was such an Amazing/Powerful movie,I cried during this movie. I got ill very suddenly in 2012 and I was told by 6 gastroenterologists theres nothing wrong with me but it took until Sept 2018 to be diagnosed with a rare condition its changed my life so much and this story is very relatable yet its an amazing story This was the first film I actually cried for. If you’re somehow feeling hopeless right now help yourself and go watch this movie. \n\nGod bless you always Beam family! 💗 I love this movie so much every time I watch it I tear up Usually, Miracles happens when we least expect it or completely forgot about it. The worst is when it happens when we don\'t need it or yearn for it anymore. The real excitement is if it happens when it is least expected and when the heart still wants it to happen. I absolutely love this movie! I watched this movie when it came out in theaters and it honestly made me believe in God again. My favorite movie I am an atheist yet I still enjoy this movie it always makes me cry 🙌 I saw the movie I love it it\'s so sad and touching! So inspirational! I was crying This movie had me in tears the whole time it truly is beautiful please please watch it I watch this three times maybe even four and every time I tear up but at the end I always say thank you God you know it\'s just a movie I still say thank you God for healing this little girl 😭😖💖 Wonderful movie ,love it <3 Every time when I see this I always cry and it touches my HEART this movie is touching and \nit made me cry in a joyful way.\n\ncall on god  JUST PICKED THIS MOVIE UP TODAY; WATCHING IT NOW. SUCH A BLESSING... BEAUTIFUL MOVIE. Everyone who sees this movie complains about how the trailer gives away the entire plot of the movie, but I personally disagree. Seeing the movie myself, I didn\'t think the plot was entirely composed of Annabel falling into the tree and being healed from it. That was really just a small bit of the end. I thought the plot was more composed of Annabel being sick and her family\'s struggle to keep faith during the long journey through her illness. I\'ll agree that the trailer gives away the end of the movie, but really not the whole plot like people keep saying. WOW what a powerful, emotional film. I don\'t think I\'ve ever cried so much watching a movie! lol.\nWas a bit annoyed that I knew what was gonna happen at the end cos I\'d watched this trailer a few days ago!! Thanks to Team Beam, for sharing this Beautiful Story of Faith, not just Religion. I watch it over and over. Annabelle, Thank You, from the bottom of my Heart! <3 Sending Prayers and Love to all out there who need it. Keep the Faith <3 I\'m not usually even religious but this is a nostalgic film for me, i used to see this everywhere on tv when it came out but now was the first time that i actually watched it with an open ear and a listening mind. Feels good really. I legit cried through this movie. It’s very touching and shows how God is ALWAYS there for us. i just finished the movie  and its so great the sad part was when she fell into that tree and her  little sister was trying  to dig in the soil I couldn\'t help but cry i don\'t even think i could handle the feels in this movie After watching this movie, i believe in God\'s miracles. God bless us all! When she said he told me ill be fine I cried because he saved her from death God is truly amazing also when she said I just wanna die I cried so much it breaks me knowing that the devil caused that much pain to a 7 yr old than God healed her 👼 This movie makes me cry bc I am just like her and I went through almost exactly what she went through. I normally was so sick I couldn’t walk even after I could walk with a brace. I went into many hospitals when I was a kid and they rejected me and said “she is perfectly healthy” and I found out I had EOE and celiac. I was so sick I wouldn’t stop puking and I almost died SO MANY TIMES. I can hardly count how many times I almost died. Some people said that I had such a rough life and I am so sad by it. I could not talk for a really long time and I couldn’t walk even with a brace until I was 4. I couldn’t breathe at times. And I still have flashbacks of a TON of doctors surrounding me and running with the hospital bed into immediate surgery. I also am still struggling so much with it today. I still can’t breathe at times and guess what? I got another disease. It’s a skin disease. I struggle so much I can hardly explain it but it is much worse than what I wrote here bc I can’t think about it without me crying. God bless u all. And praise Jesus!! one of the best movies I\'ve seen. well worth it. I have never watched this movie until now..It is the best movie ever❤ It changed my life💕 Kudos to the trailer music designer! Not exactly the same version of ""Fight Song"" as the original, but with the choral and orchestration, they nailed it with the theme of the movie! I\'d love to find the full version. The movie made cry 3 times at least. My girl, which is very healthy thanks to Allah, looks like the little Anna. Really incredible story! This really makes me crying. I wish this miracle happened in my life too. 🥺🥺 I love this movie still to this day🥺 I remember watching this movie with my ""sister"" and I cried so much Came back and watched this again :(( I\'m Hoping and Praying to Daddy God that my mom can also have her miracle 😭💔 Miracles do happen anywhere at anytime.. Just have faith.. I saw this when it came out and i was so touched by it i love these kind of movies I’m 10, and, this movie is so good! I love it! It’s one of my fav movies The trailer got me balling my eyes out I watched this about two times in the past, I almost cried. It was that good i love this movie sooooo much i recommend it very much its sad but heartwarming I just watched this movie on Netflix, the movie is about 1 hour and 49 mins, I started crying from where they found out the little girl is sick until the end of the movie with non stop NON STOP remembering every minute when my little one was at the hospital and spent 6 months at the NICU and he made it, yes he made it. He’s known by a miracle baby. I felt the pain the mother was going through, and I remembered myself crying and praying to God  to save him for me by his incubator. I can’t be more grateful 😞 very touching movie! I was crying so hard when she fell from that tree who else broke out in tears Just came to see the trailer to find out about the movie...as soon as the music played and saw the girl running up the front walk...I had goosebumps...Miracles are real and God works them.  God Bless this family, and all those who watch this...<3 I just watched this movie, I love it soooo much!! ☺️😜 you watch the trailer and you think ""oh it\'s good but now i know everything about the movie"" then you watch the movie ""wowww i had no idea it could be this good"", then you watch the movie again ""woww, hows is it 10X better the second time i watch it??"" Just seen this like 4 hours ago, for the first time. I cried 3 times. One of the best and most emotional movies I have ever watched it\'s the second movie make me cry 😢 and increase my faith ❤ miracles are everywhere around us  and god never let us alone again  💓 May be I saw it 10 Times but I can\'t get enough for it noo word to describe ❤❤❤ Everyone talks about how the trailer tells the whole movie, but with a film like this is not about the plot line (we already know how it ends). It\'s about the emotional rollercoaster it takes you through and trust by quarter way through you\'ll be bawling even if you have a stone for a heart I absolutely love this movie i saw this movie and cried through nearly the whole thing because i had a condition when i was a toddler very similar to her. im so glad i survived I watched this movie 4 years ago when i was just 10 and to this day i still recommend it Can\'t believe it\'s Jenifer garner and that girl from girls trip, I\'m so happy that they acted in a Christian movie, fyi if u haven\'t watched it you should, its very touching and it would help you appreciate the Almighty God more. God Is The Greatest, don\'t forget to pray and study your Bible always 😉 So, we started watching this in our computer class but I never got the chance to finish it not until Thursday so I had to search it 😂😂😂 And BTW, I literally felt chills. I\'m not going to spoil anything but the ending in the church is the best part There are two ways of living life. When nothing is miracle or everything is a miracle.❤ For anyone considering watching this movie, do it!! It\'s the most incredible movie i have seen I loved this movie so much❤❤ The movie is amazing I loved it😍😇🙏🏻 I just watched this movie on lifetime it was the saddest and most emotional movie I have ever seen but it was sad in a good way it was a true miracle the saddest thing is there actually are innocent children out there suffering and need help i just finish watching heaven is for real and then i see the link in this new trailer with the same producer. i love watching this religious christian movie it just lift up your spirit to God. that miracles do happen if you believe i love this i watch it thousand times its so sad and beautiful It\'s definitely worth watching ❤️ I remember this movie took 2 hours to finally find it loved it! I watched this movie 4 times and I cried every time I can’t wait to finish the book. I wanna see this movie SO FREAKIN BAD!

I’m not exactly religious, or believe in god, but this movie was amazing. 8/10 recommend. Filme maravilhoso. Caso real meu Deus Omfg I got tingles as soon as fight song came on omg!!!!

It\'s very touching I LITERALLY CRIED😭😭😭 I watched this movie and it was AMAZING! Highly recommend for any Christians!! I remember this movie made me cry.There\'s just so much heartbreaking scenes. I cry a lot when the scene of the hailey\'s father in the church,for many years I turn away from God,i\'m the type of men who can\'t cry easily but when I watched this it\'s so touching and clarify my doubt about God existence.Thank you for make this type of inspirational movie,such a bless for me and others Its such a lovely movie❤️ i watched this before the trailer oh my.. i don\'t remember the last time i cried and in this i had to for 3times it really build my faith in God.

I want to watch this! <3 I\'m proud to be a Christian <3 This film made me cry..... beautiful movie❤️ This movie is so beautiful. It\'s so sad how Drs often say ""its just lactose intolerance"" when clearly it is not. I\'ve been told that many times. Now I\'m diagnosed with Gastroparesis and I think something else is going on too. Drs keep sending me away. I asked for gastric emptying test myself and my Dr said I don\'t need it and it confirmed I have Gastroparesis. Keep fighting everyone.

Okay if the trailer gave away all the movie, than don’t watch it people 🤷🏼\u200d♀️, I still watched it and there is still TONS to know about the movie, it is very heart touching, I was almost balling my eyes out watching this movie, I watched it so many times, that I still cry every time, I highly recommend that you watch this movie! ❤️✊ people say that the trailer already shows the whole movie...

I love this film 💓 I got the chills😭❤️ Such a beautiful trailer ❤ LOVE THIS MOVIE but it was sad when she fell.

The trailer gave away the entire story line, I feel like I already seen the movie The fact that this movie is based on a true story 🥺 Jesus is real.🙏🏽❤️ this was an awesome movie and I watched it two times because it was that good It is a very sad and amazing film!I like very much.😍 This is a VERY GREAT movie !❤️ This movie was so good I cried so much omg...please watch it I watched it and I cried three times Watched this movie like ten times as we have a sick child with similar condition just waiting for our miracles 🙏 Me, 1 minute in: Wow this is intense I hope this little girl lives at the end of the movie.\nTrailer, 2 minutes in: Don\'t worry she will. Can\'t wait for this film to come out! A lot of people are saying that the trailer gave the whole thing away. It didn\'t. There\'s an incredibly touching backstory to this and I recommend you watch this. One of my favorite movie.. Love it I don’t believe in deity’s but this was in fact touching and made me even cry. I cried when I watched this movie and I have never this movie is amazing and has a great moral about god always have faith in god This movie gonna be awesome. God is the worker of miracles. Inspiring story to believe in miracles. I got chills so many times it takes alot to make me teary eyed, let alone cry...this movie did just that One of my favourite Christian movies. God is sooooooo good! It\'s a must watch!! Even though I don’t believe in religion I believe in god and this movie put me into tears .\nSuch a heartfelt movie I love this movie there are no doctors in the world the only doctor is God I was just about to watch it, and I already cried watching the trailer Miracles are God\'s way of letting us know\nthat you\'re not alone you are with God! This movie is so \ntouched me and make me cry about Annabel Beam it make\nmy heart  and my soul also i absolutely love this movie with everything that i have❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ This movie made me cry but when Queen Latifah came in and what she did was hilarious😂😂😂🤘🏻🤘🏻👏🏻👌🏻 Loved this movie! This movie is so sad, I watched it and was in so many tears 😢😢😢😢😢😪😪😪 though you feel like watching the whole movie by this preview, it is also God\'s will so people would know there is a miracle in this world... I hope children who are suffering from illness get better like Annabell! There is an eternal life afterwards and we will know when we get there I\'ve watched this before and I cried so much😣😣😢😢😭😭 When will it come out in Australia! I need to see it! This is such a good movie, it’s so touching The way I know these are all true is because now matter how many times I watch it I get goosebumps i cried during the movie it was so touching A lot of people are saying they don\'t need to see the movie, but I just watched it on Netflix right now and there is more to the movie than the trailer. It\'s one of the best movies I\'ve watched and it\'s a definite watch. This is probably my favoritest movie ever! I have a sick child with dysmotility disorder and this movie is deff hope for all the parents and family members like myself going through this. Even thou i cried the whole movie  as its really touching seeing what we go through on a daily basis and even if your not a believer the fact that this girl got cured from this condition which i can say is hell  is very important. What a incredible true movie!!! I loveddd this movie... watched it thrice and cried all the times👍👍👍👍 Had the pleasure of being on the Georgia sets for a couple of weeks.\nThe whole cast was great and I got a free Third Day concert out of it and even chatted it up with Mac for a bit. My uncle took us to see this movie when it came out it is very touching movie. It was the best movie I seen Brilliant, good to know this girl got healed which definitely proves god exists... We\'ll just pretend the thousands of other children who die from sickness never happen then... And those who live in horrible conditions in 3rd world countries probably deserve it... And those being abused, all they need is to pray more. Its all about this little girl...:/ I mean, I don\'t want to be a party pooper here-- but give me a break. This is the best movie ever made 😍 I hope they make another movie 🤞🏽🤞🏽🤞🏽🤞🏽 I got so many chills just watching this i love this i watch it Thousand times its so sad and beautiful I saw the movie Miracles From Heaven at the movie theaters back in 2016. Miracles From Heaven is my favorite movie ever based on a true story. the same thing happened to me .   like everyone, i behaved like a brave father and cried all time in bathroom and asked why me and why my little  kid.  like in the movie, there were not much people to help us. My business went down. We were struggling for money.    when last test is done, he was completely cured. he stopped medicine from next week and he is absolutely alright now.   i thank all prayed for him. that film has completely changed my life and strength relation with my father...hats off The most that socked me in the movie is that at the end I saw that this was a real story This film was amazing !!! I loved this movie when i watched it!! <333 I watched this film yesterday. It\'s amazing I just only watched the trailer....I got tears in my eyes...like what??

I just watched the movie and before I watched it I saw a video about Anna and I already knew what happened and I still cried all throughout the movie I still don\'t get why people still don\'t believe in god this girl literally went to heaven and back Miracles do happen only if you believe we watched this at school and the whole class was crying. :( Good ending though <3 This made me cry ❤️ This is my favorite movie it’s so inspireing this movie made me cry, sucha beautiful story. i watched this movie today it’s amazing some of y’all r saying he’s not real, y’all can have ur opinions, but i strongly recommend learning about him, it changes ur life for the better!🙏💙💚 This movie made me cry.

This trailer gets me so happy This gets me so emotional I love this movie. 🤗 OMG I SO WANT TO SEE THIS!! I cant believe this is a true story😱 its inspired me soooo much I watched the movie and 😭 cried... what can I say its based on a true story 😭😭😭😭 My mom got really sick when she was pregnant with my 2 year old sister. She had all kinds of doctors coming to see her and look and see what\'s wrong. She had every single test done on her and was told that they did not know what was wrong with her. I dont know how to describe how sick she was. We had pepole prying from all over the world and they told her she was ganna die. They also would say they need to take my little sis at 4mouths in the wom (I think she was 4 mouths) life was crazy. But God stepped in!!! He took her sickness and told it to leave her body and she has not been that sick since. Her and my sister are alive and well. And we\'re so blessed to have everyone together in my family! Just all I can say it Thank you God. I love my sister and mom. Now my mom home schools my brother and I we all work together in the house and we all think of this every time someone talks about miracles. Every time I wach this movie it makes me think about what God has in store for us and it makes me think about this. God bless you all! Alwys wanted to see this. Never got around to it!!!!!!! “He told me I’s d be fine!!”-Anna “Who told yu yu’d be fine?!” BEST QUOTES EVER!!!!!!! One of the best movie I\'ve ever watched Remember God has a path made for you, sometimes it’s not what you would choose I just watched this today in school, i wasn’t expecting this to be based on a true story Freaking. Most. Beautiful. Movie. I. Have. Ever. Seen. I love this movie!!!!! Even the non religious people need to watch this. It pulls tears from the deepest part of your souls I swear 💜🥺😭 I cry every time I see this movie 😭😭😭 I admire these real people\'s courage in these situations I\'m an atheist but I find this sorry absolutely without a dought an incredible miracle we are all connected and that\'s all that matters Très beau film, très émouvant et sublime.\nheureusement y a Queen Latifah qui est la pour nous faire rire principalement j\'était mdr avec sa belle voiture\nje recommande fortement. That\'s God......does the impossible OH MY GOD THATS SO BEAUTIFUL!!!! I saw the movie and it is so touching ! This was actually pretty good. It reminds me of Anita Moojani\'s NDE, and how she was told she would be cured of her cancer if she ""went back."" The speech by j garner near the end of the film made me cry I\'m blessed. Worth watching this movie. I recommend to watch this movie you\'ll feel blessed that God is everything. I\'m an atheist, but I still really want to see this movie. I havent watch the movie yet and im already crying- God is Faith!I loved this Movie!!😍⛪👌 My Mom cried while watching this movie!!!😭😭 touching movie💗 I seen this movie when it first came out and omgggggggggggggggggggggggg I love it wish that my daughter get healthy too i have watched this 100 times and i still watch it i wanna meet the real girl who fell in the tree XD It was a really good movie :3 The trailer * this little girl fell 30 feet and it did not kill her or Paralyze her it healed her\n\nMe * wow this is a I love the story and god is real*🥰🥰 God bless this child! I saw this movie, I loved it This movie is more touching then the movie breakthrough. I believe in God too because if it wasn\'t for him I might have not survived cancer. I always believe in miracles ....the hope for the hard life... Thank god! I didn\'t watched this trailer before i watch full movie Love it Had no idea this was so close to home... literally travel the same streets for years..... just watched this and highly recommend! Ah! God is so Good!!!! I still believe!!! When I watched the movie I was so emotional It\'s just amazing what our god can do ♥️ Goosebumps I love that movie Real Tearjerker. Absolutely ❤it. Never ever lose your faith,\'cos wherever we go,no matter how many sins we made,he is still,and is always,always,always with us😇☝ I watched this movie today and I cried 5 times but no one new this is the best movie I have EVER SEEN I\'m not a believer but this movie made me understand why some people do believe. Beautiful story. I watched the movie and i cried!!!!! He told me I\'d be fine!\n\nWho told you\'d be fine? This movie showed me to have faith in God, and it also told me that with God I can do anything good I\'ve already saw this movie.. This is a great and inspirational Movie.. God is great!!! I watched this movie a long time ago and I think I cried I watched this movie today and it is beautiful.... However 1 of the cover\'s for the movie has only the Mother and Daughter..and another has the Mother, Daughter and the Doctor. I believe it would serve us all best if the cover really reflected all that helped in the process....inclusive of the Pastor...showing the importance of collective support. Which is what the family got. In my view this was more a Miracle from Heaven and Earth... Yes God helped, but so did human beings as well.... Which was all part of the miracle... I cried when I watched the movie (I’m also glad I’ve never watched the film before I watched the movie) When they said lactose intolerant, acid reflex, I\'m like oh well I\'m both lol i remember me and my friends watched this movie in our church 3 years ago.. nice film. Glad to watched it in 2:32 minutes I just couldn’t stop crying from start to finish😭😭😭 Watching this trailer made me cry a little.😢 we and my classmate watch at our school i fell in love in this movie émouvent <3 so much feels I love the movie miracles from Heaven I washed it five times When she fell 30 feet into a tree, she didn\'t get injured at all\n\nWhen I fell 5 feet from a tree, I broke my wrist Jen Garner. A very passionate actress. Very beautiful ❤️ Gods Power Is like no other!🙌💕 This movie is great  highly recommended 😘 This is the first movie that made me cry. I saw this movie and I almost cried Did anyone went to see this movie only because of Eugenio Derbez? :) Well, looks like I don\'t have to watch the movie to see how unbelievable and melodramatic it is. this is literallt the best movie ever wow This movie makes me shake. It’s amazing Los milagros son sobrenaturales. Jesús es grande ❤❤❤ It\'s not always bad to believe in Almighty ..... Just don\'t push other people into believing .....😇😇 If your girl and your on your monthly DO NOT WATCH THIS UNLESS YOU WANNA SWIM IN A POOL OF YOUR TEARS It\'s that there is such an emotion in this movie Why cant they make more movies like this instead of those movies that inspire people to be more evil? I cried a lot 🥺 idk why but when the music goes hard it makes me feel an urge to burst in tears Movie is amazing !!! Praise the lord 🙏❤️ Saw this in netflix today, i cried a 5times!!!😢Some parts i ugly cry.. 😭😭 Oh she didn\'t die? Cool. Thanks for showing me the entire movie. This movie really made me cry so hard .. I don\'t get how all these people disliked this movie... This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I saw the movie and it was so good 😊 There can be MIRACLES, when you BELIEVE... woww what a  movie. just saw the movie. i wish the family all the best, i have children too, i wath with my wife and we were crying like it was raining. i love you guys and wish you annabelle and the whole family all the best.. greatings from turkey This movie is about that Anna has a sick in the stomach or cancer in the stomach that cannot be relieved or cannot be okay\nWhen they went home her sister went into a tree the branch was starting too fall her sister said that she had to go to the flat surface but that tree was too old so it was hallow inside the tree she was alive but the mother didn\'t believe in god at first so she started hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit thy womb jesus Even if someone is atheist will end up in tears at the ending scene of this movie. Today I was so broken that now i think it was something from heaven that I randomly played this movie !! I watched it in 2016 and I cried and I never cry during a movie. Jesus is so real 🤍🤍🤍 It was only Him that healed her!! This movie is so beautiful I highly recommend! This movie is basic on a true story,   i might of seeing this movie lots of times and there a book about it to. 😀  two ways to live life through nothing is a miracle and the other as everyday is a miracle. Keep the faith. 🙏 it\'s a true story Glory to God.. Jesus is our miracle worker & healer ❤️❤️❤️ Have faith with God, and as well as the doctor.\nThe Child saves thank god.\nThe Child dies sues the doctor. \nSeriously, some people just did. This is a beautiful story I watched this movie today and balled my eyes out lol I watched it it\'s the most beautiful movie ever this is an amazing movie God is real I litteraly live this movie its the best i always get goos bumps watching this I FREAKING KNOW THE AUTHOR AND THE LITTLE GIRL IRL  IM NOT KIDDING I can\'t stop watching the movie like I think I watched for about a million times this movie is a living legend I have not seen this movie, but it looks soooo good!!!!!! I saw the movie and I cried so many times that I cant go to sleep This movie made me cry so much that I had to get some tongues and the Oscar goes to.............. ........ .  ...........The Tree!!! for best actor/healer congratulations People are saying there is no point in watching the movie now. But I recommend you do watch it. It\'s so touching.\nHuman race always say they need a Miracle, but when the miracle happens they don\'t believe it. Fight song is the perfect song for Annabel\'s situation👼🏼❤️ I was looking for this movie when the girl fell down the well me and my family was crying at the end I was almost crying, just at the Trailer. I know that I will be boo hoo-ing to watch the film, but it looks really good. You sold me with Jennifer Garner & Queen Latifah. I\'m down. A real beautiful movie.....don\'t miss it! The 1K that disliked this are probably going to Hell.   Great job \nThe movie is excellent. omgosh.. look, I am a christian. This is awesome. Everybody, dont loose your faith in God. Its been years and I didnt watched this movie before. BELIEVE, JUST BELIEVE. it annoys me when people say this movie is sad. yes, it is sad that she has an incurable disease. but the movie is about how she fell down a tree and was miraculously healed. isn\'t that happy, not sad? THIS MAKES ME CRY! I WISH I SAW THE MOVIE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I watch it over and over because it is soooooo 😌 So me and my best friend watched this movie because I wanted to show her it and then a week later I got hurt really bad I couldn’t do stuff properly and I was thinking if it was a sign or something I am all better now running and playing with my friends! My daughter and grandchildren went to the theater to see this movie. The roller coaster ride this movie took us on was AMAZING!!! PRAISE THE LORD the movie industry offered our children good, faith based movies to find in the open public. My daughter offered the boys the opportunity to choose ANY movie, my heart nearly exploded when they chose THIS above the movie the originally choice to see (Godzilla). I was blessed and proud. If there were more faith based movies to choose from, children would hopefully continue to lean towards God inspired entertainment vs violence. . They deserve the choice, right? omg I cant wait for this movie to come out ""me 5 years later OMG I I FORGOT ABOUT THIS movie i searched it up in youtube hopeing it would be here :(  no just the trailer"" I WATCH U AGAIN SOOON"" this is not a trailer its a spoiler .-. I don\'t know why but this made me ahead a tear It seems like after mom said ""can you even hear me?"" The tree branch breaking was his way of ""yes I can"" and he healed her I love this movie so much ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️ It was such a beautifull movie , cried so much , don\'t watch the trailer it will give everything away ! Honestly seems like a super sweet movie I can\'t look at the actress who plays the older sister the same after seeing her kill her younger sister in the walking dead Omg just watching the trailer made me cry. We watch this in my classroom and my house.i did not cry but some of myclassmates did cry.i feel that the song is very touchful and the trailer.fight song is my favorite.😍 It\'s a beautiful film. !! I love god as always and I\'m thankful for god\nFor everything that he give us ,I\'m just thankful This movie really hits different 😞🥺 Anna: He told me I\'ll be fine...\nMom: Who told you you\'ll be fine?\nAnna: ...\nMom: ... Goosebumps and shivers down my spine.....wow😮😮😮😮it’s amazing just.....really goooddd I wanna watch it gys change your ways Jesus is coming soon🌈🌈🌈🌸🌸🌸🌸 Let’s be humble and admit that we need God almighty . This made me tear up More you experience more u become spiritual. I love this movie When she fell off  tree I  cried cause I thought she wouldn’t make it but god does his thing I cried when I watched this movie Nothing insults me more as an ICU nurse than when family thank God for saving their loved one\'s life. No, my 20 minute CPR while covered in their blood and the doctors saved their life. If there is a ""God"" then he is the reason why we had to do it in the first place. Miracle happens and Jesus saves till this day. Amen. GLORY AND ALL THANKS TO OUR LORD JESUS. FOREVER AND EVER. its such a spiritual uplifting movie....like it Great movie! :) I got to watch this in theaters and I started crying, I\'m not kidding Iwatch this iwas only child I didn\'t know this was beautiful movie and this was really so touching I\'d always remember this I watched this whole movie and I suggest you watch it plz my mom said pretty much the same thing when we didn’t know what was wrong the line “You run some more tests, I’m not leaving this hospital until i know what’s wrong with my daughter!” Awww, omg this is great I bought this movie and still watching it. I cried 4 times during this movie... I had a stomach flu before in 6th grade, the pain was very huge, I threw up a lot and couldn\'t even move, so I can\'t imagine the pain this little girl felt when she had pseudo-obstruction i dont know this is a trailer or a spoiler. we all know the ending already LOL. This is a Christian movie but this is the most heart touching movie I have ever seen in my entire life it\'s so good you really should watch it To Everyone Who Thinks the story is fake you don\'t believe in miracles imagine if this happens to you?would you still not believe? I was put in the hospital when I feel off the stairs I opens my head and miracles happen thats why your still alive to this day!everyone should be live because it gives you a miracle when you fall off somehing!So stop the dislikes it won\'t make the world better it will just make people think its fake and won\'t believe in miracles like everyone else!so stop!😡🙂 I just saw the movie and it made me cry multiple times. It might\'ve just been because I was having weird moodswings, but the whole movie was just so emotional and I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen better acting in a movie. It\'s like when mom said ""can you even hear me?"" The branch breaking was His way of saying ""yes I can"" and He healed the daughter I love Jennifer Garner❤️ This movie was great and I also liked Heaven Is For Real! I only watch the Trailer, I am starting to crying....😢 I find it funny that people on here just love criticizing the movie and trailer. Yes, the trailer tells how the movie ends, but the movie shows what happens in between. \nI also find it amusing that people say ""I think she broke the branch on purpose."" Yes, because she would want to purposely break a very thick branch BOTH she and her sister were on. Then fall 30 feet to her own entertainment.  If she walked to kill herself, I\'m pretty sure she wouldn\'t also endanger her sister. This movie is about God saving her from death, and healing her. What would the chance be that she fell just right? Only God could do that. when she was stuck inside the tree it made me cry so bad that is so sad and loving at the same time wow I knew it was from the creators of Heaven is For Real, it’s very similar and one of my favorite movies. Ufffff beautiful 😍 gave me chills for sure I love this movie Mom: Who told you you\'d be fine?\nAnna: The Glorious Satan of course! jennifer garner always be the best 😍 Miracles ♥️♥️ Prayer really works ♥️🙏 I love this movie Tbh even if you’re not religious (much like me) this movie is incredible. It’s beautiful and you won’t regret watching it My favorite movie hands down If you\'re seeing this movie I suggest 2 boxes kleenex and a significant other to calm you down when hyperventilating... because you\'re crying too much. Whenever i need to cry i watch it:(.. I broke the replay button 😢 God is amazing. i\'m spending eternity with him ❤️ This is the perfect family movie Good movie special is real story I love it💕💕💕💕 Jus finished watching this movie it make me cried but it also reminded me that god is faithful Alright 50 seconds into the trailer.. already crying From the producers who made a movie on a lie a boy told....yeah, that\'s all I need to know. Faith is really the only true shelter🙏 \nmust watch this movie👌 It often amazes me when people either look, or pray, for The Almighty to intervene and cause a miracle , they simply can\'t understand how this ""miraculous"" thing happened. Inspirational movie...2 thumbs up... After seeing this movie i cried a lot because i never believed in god but now i do. Everything happens in life has reason, trust him. I love it Movies like these always makes me cry. I just wanna say that God is good and that miracles do happen. :) This movie made me cry so bad 😔 This trailer made me cry 😢 I love this movie i have cried This is such a good movie One of the best movies in the world for me I just realized the father in this is Dr. Riggs from greys anatomy XD Es una reflexión única,🙏🏼para recordarnos que Dios esiste,💜y que es el mismo, ayer, hoy, y por los siglos. 🙌🏼HEBREOS:13:8😇 ']","[-1, 2, 3, -2, 1, -1, 1, -3, -2, 3, 2, -1, 2, 3, -2, -2, -2, -1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, -1, -3, 4, 3, -1, -3, 1, 1, -2, 1, 2, 2, -1, 3, -4, 4, 3, 3, 2, -1, 2, 2, -4, 2,

The Tomorrow War,"['QPistcpGB8o', 'WOx8TZFvfsw', 'RQjEbkV-9ZM', 'P0y5jg-F0Kk', '_TQfaaOjFYQ']","['The Tomorrow War An American family watching a football game? This is the most sci-fi scene in the trailer. Loved this movie. Solid cast, straight-forward yet interesting ideas, and some surprisingly unique twists. If you like Terminator and Edge of Tomorrow, you\'ll definitely like The Tomorrow War. The movie is surprisingly good! People said it\'s a little cheesy but hey he\'s a family man. He\'s gotta do what a father must do. His wife helped him along the way. That\'s something rare in movies. The middle part just honestly such a tear-jerking moment. Would definitely watch it again! 10/10! That jump he made for his daughter was the most amazing scene in the whole movie... This movie is a lot more intense than i expected... Finished watching this movie, and I for one cried at some scenes where they showed him and his daughter. Did not expect anything from an alien movie but it was real good  I have to admit in my 26 years of living only 2 movies have brought me to tears and this movie right here just became number 3. Just really makes you appreciate family and also brilliantly touched on how PTSD affects service personnel. Brilliant movie 10/10 That\'s my Star-Lord. This movie was fantastic. Great to see someone addressing the issues which plague veterans and their families. Albeit a fantastical plot, the PTSD and employment struggles are real. Good on Chris Pratt for this piece of art. This was actually loads better than I thought it would be. Probably the sci-fi movie of 2021 so far for me. I\'d give this a 10/10 just on how it portrays the love a father has for his daughter alone. Best movie ever. I’ve watched twice now and can’t get enough of it. It is completely different from expectations. It is completely different from other movies. It is exactly what a war in real life would look like.  The guns are not made a joke of. It is absolutely brilliant. If all movies are like this. Il never get enough. There is other words but brilliant. Beats marvel dc and all other movies made in years. I been dying to find one more good movies for about 10 years now. And this did it. This is exactly how action should look like. I am sick of other movies making jokes out of guns and army. This fits the word satisfying like a glove. I had the option to see fast and furious or this. I dint think twice to watch this instead. I am seriously satisfied I can’t express It gives a reminder to all of us about how important to have a whole family. Let them feel loved while they\'re still around!! Great story and amazing casts!! Rating this one from 1-10? It\'s 11 for me!!  This looks like a weird mix of every genre Chris Pratt has been in. Hands down one of the best movies I watched in a while, this deserves 5 stars. Chris, and Santa fight scene with the alien is just epic. Must watch!! This movie deserves waaaaay higher than a 6.8 on IMDb, it\'s at least an 8 for me! I love this! \nHumans can\'t run as fast as these (near the end 1 moment). \nOther than that, it was great! Awesome character development, not too much fighting to the point of boredom, lots of story telling and emotions! The character grows a lot in his 7 days too! I loved it! It was also very nice to see Yvonne in a leading role! I love her! This movie made me tear up the way he changed from going to the future and learning how he changed from his daughter. He came back a man that realized he has everything in front of him/family. This movie surprised me so much I came in expecting nothing and got everything from Chris pratt ""Second chances are really hard to come by"", yes indeed. By far the best movie of 2021. Chris Pratt didn\'t mess up foolishly this time like he did with Thanos :3 \nAlso this is one of the best alien based science fictions I have ever seen. Good plot, good action scenes and some good twists as well. Undoubtedly, one of the best movies until now in 2021. Honestly, I\'m going to pretend this is the Edge of Tomorrow sequel. Just watched it. One of the best sci-fi action movies I’ve seen in years. It was tense, full of action and very emotional. And I like how it ended, I suspected a different ending and glad I was way off. The acting is really good. Especially from the main actress. 10/10 his trailer sound weirdly similar to the one from Black Widow Not gonna spoil it. It\'s a solid action flick.   I recommend it. It has some flaws to it from a nerd/military perspective but it can be given a pass. The characters are a hit and miss but some of the side characters really surprised me. I think alot of people will enjoy it. This was a great movie. My whole family gathered around to watch this movie which is what we needed since 2020  keep us distant from one another. I love the movie plot and how important time, family, and all nations are to God and how we should continue to work together to keep evil out the world. God Bless the actors, producers and directors who made this film.. I give thanks to Jesus Christ always and again thanks for the great Sci fi film.  God Bless  Even though, I didn\'t got to see this movie in a whole piece but i could manage it to see in parts. I was totaly connected with the storyline. Film portrays a beautiful dad-daughter relationship. Every aspect seems to be in sync; the past, the future, people. It is really a good movie. This movie deserve more credit than given from the critics. It isn\'t Alien but it\'s actually a very well produced sci-fi action movie. Some say the story is weak or a mess but as with any sci-fi movie you have to buy into the concept of the world and the rules of the specific story and if you buy the terms of this movie it all makes perfectly sense. Good acting, great CGI except for a few scenes an great sound effects. All in all worth a watch for any sci-fi lovers. Loved this movie. I usually never rewatch a trailer after watching the movie but i had to tell yall how good the movie was. Legendary Outlaw becomes a legendary soldier This movie was fare more intense than i ever expected. Its basically like ""A Quiet Place"" but without the quietness. just finished watching the movie and omg...speechless, i didnt expect this level if intensity or emotional rollercoaster! \nyou guys have to watch it trust me u wont regret it! The movie was really good. Better than most of the Alien franchise movies. This is one of the best movies I have seen for quite a while.  Action packed from the very start of the movie.  Just watched it on Amazon Prime.  If you like Sci Fi thrillers, this movie meets that category.  take care. It was actually a really good watch. I didn\'t expect that I would like it, I was reluctant to watch it at first.\n \nCGI was great. The alien design was good. Story was decent. Nice twist. There might be some plot holes and things that could\'ve been added that will make more sense but all in all the movie was entertaining and fun. I didn\'t got bored at all. Why do the aliens look and sound like a combo of Edge of tomorrow and A quite place This movie was cool! 4 out 5 stars! Had good  humor, action, emotional scenes and story line. \nIf you thinking about watching it, do it. Only bummer is there isn\'t any set up for a part 2...or is there?  Enjoy guys This movie had us crying. It made me appreciate how much my daughter loves her daddy bc she would so do this, and so would he. they are perfect. I ain\'t watched the end but I will soon I really enjoyed this movie, not gonna lie I cried a bit. I loved this movie so much mainly cause of the amazing alien design, finally some actually scary enemies, very good movie  Really good movie!!! So go that I didn’t even realize how long it was until the credits started rolling️ A little over two hours but it keeps your attention. Emotionally, the movie had parts that choked me up, made me feel nervous, made me laugh, a little scared, motivated and hopeful. And let’s not forget the ending. Thank you for not leaving us with a horrible cliff hanger! That’s what I call an execution of a movie  Bruh, they don\'t need Chris Pratt for this. they have Omni Man Scifi movie with a happy ending without the loss of most of the main characters is a good movie in my view. And this is that movie. Wouldn\'t it make more sense to go back in time and alter human civilization to prepare for the arrival of the aliens?.\n\nUpdate: thanks for your comments both interesting and unhinged.  I have seen the movie. My question was answered. I liked the movie. That is all. Worth every seconds, 10/10 for me. Hope he doesn\'t lose his calm this time because previous time half the universe wiped out  This movie has the kind of vibes that i like. Thanks to the tomorrow war team for making this movie \nLove futuristic alien war based movies.\nBut i felt sad when Muri was killed and eaten alive by the aliens. \nHoping to see more movies like this from amazon prime This movie is awesome. The design of the aliens is really neat. Chris thanks his fans:\n""Happy Fourth of July to everybody in America, and to everybody around the world I want to say to all of you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,"" Pratt said in the video. ""You have helped to make Tomorrow War the number one movie in the world. I\'m feeling pumped, to say the least, and filled with gratitude. The first 48 hours of global viewing for The Tomorrow War on Prime Video, it\'s broken all the records, and it\'s the number one streaming movie in the world. We really could not have done that without each and every one of you. Thank you for watching; thank you for your positive audience reactions. If you haven\'t had a chance to see the movie, check it out. I\'m so proud of my baby, she\'s all grown up and terrorizing the world with hideous aliens. To everyone out there Fourth of July weekend, stay safe, celebrate independence this weekend, and like I said, to the rest of our friends around the world thank you so much."" Chris Pratt should\'ve been playing Nathan Drake in Uncharted. He even speaks like him from the games! When I saw this relationship between father and daughter in this movie, suddenly tears had come out of my eyes. I have cried a lot of times after watching this movie. the first time, I couldn\'t have control over my tears.. This movie will be remembered for a lifetime. Love You too much sir. Chris party ( dan forester and Yvonne strahovski ( muri ). Muri, you are great daughter. Me and my fiance loved this movie. Chris did really well in it, the action was really good and good job on the aliens. They looked badass. Must watch. 10/10  A good sci-fi film that I\'ve been needing for a good while. Love Chris and all the other actors. This was great. Wow! Absolutely loved this. Best action movie I\'ve seen this year, hands down. Sure there\'s some cheesy scenes here and there, but overall it\'s just awesome! 10/10 would recommend! This movie has one of the most emotional story arcs I have EVER SEEN!!!!! The premise is so absurd though that the character arc overtakes the story.....and it goes to show you can have the most CRAZY STORYLINE IMAGINABLE but if you don\'t have fleshed out characters it falls flat. This did not I genuinely cried at one point. KUDOS for making this more then a generic alien invasion film and making this a GREAT STORY!!!! Really surprised by this movie honestly really good I just watched this movie today. The people watching the trailer right now need to see it! It was absolutely awesome! I love movies with happy endings and in which the hero and main characters don\'t die in the end. This checks those boxes. Loved the movie. Except Chris, mostly the TV series actors. Everyone did exceptionally well. Production quality is phenomenal. Truly deserves the appreciation its getting. Well narrated story. Was expecting a typical climax where hero tries to save the world and dies. But it went “taken” route. One who loves his family and daughter, and if it takes saving the world, he would. Excellent, action packed movie. One of the best pure adrenaline action films I\'ve seen in a long time. Highly recommend! JEEEZ I’M AMAZED HOW INCREDIBLE THIS MOVIE TURNED OUT. 10000/10 So this isn\'t an ""Edge of Tomorrow"" sequel?, cause I feel like it totally should be. I didn\'t expect anything from this movie, and I was very impressed by it. Awesome movie. A must watch. This movie is really good, one of the best I\'ve seen in awhile. When I saw this relationship between father and daughter in this movie, suddenly tears had come out of my eyes. I have cried a lot of times after watching this movie. the first time, I couldn\'t have control over my tears.. This movie will be remembered for a lifetime. Love You too much sir. Chris party ( dan forester and Yvonne strahovski ( muri ). Muri, you are great daughter. Aside from the cliche moments and lines, the story and action were pretty good. Loved this movie. The trailer was perfect, it didn\'t give away too much. This may be corny but this movie makes me grateful for one thing that matters the most: family.. I enjoyed every bit of this movie...got me teary too Props to the makers of the trailer for keeping the threat on screen for such a short amount of time. The trailer doesn’t need to show us who they are or what they look like - save it for the full film. Madness! Amazing action movie, enjoyed from first to last second! was worried a 130 mins scy fy movie would turn out long but this was fantastic! so glad I watched it before any spoilers! Not gonna lie the scene where the two soldiers stayed behind to defend off the aliens while the air strike was coming was pretty badass and quite sad. 10/10 scene. Honestly, the overall movie was great. I don’t see how the movie had a low rating. People nowadays just be expecting too much. ️ Phenomenal movie. Shocked I didn’t watch it for so long. Absolutely would watch again. Loved the movie.  I enjoy everything Chris Pratt brings to the screen. I loved this movie..felt like i was back in the 90s..straight to the point I was sceptical. But this was actually a good movie. It\'s so good! One of the Best sci-fi movie of 2021 so far, the ending did not disappoint! This movie was really, really good!!! Absolutely worth watching , one of the best action movies I have seen in a long time. Really enjoyed this film. Very well done and great cast. Been a long time since a good alien film was released. The greatest movie I’ve ever seen on Netflix and Chris Pratts best movie imo. The acting was superb the screenplay, dialogue, right down to the costume and set designs were just amazing. I’ve never been more entertained. loved it. One of the best movies i\'ve seen in a LONG time! It got everything! Love it! The way he calmly pulls off serious and funny at the same time is incredible I watched it yesterday when it came out and it blew my mind. I loved it.\nSPOILER ALERT   ""Remove your shirt.""\n""What\'s this for?""\n""A sexy moment in the trailer."" Woww.. absolutely amazing movie\n\nI teard up when him and his daughter had that talk on the beach best movie of the year Really amazing movie guys/gals. After a long time I will say me/ma wife enjoyed a movie at the comfort of home. Definitely not infinity war or Avatar or Titanic kind of blockbuster movie but really nailed in keeping you entertained throughout the entire movie . Just give it a try and you will never regret spending your time watching it. I saw this movie without even knowing what is was about and believe me i was amazingly satisfied from start to finish. Such a great action- adventure movie... Really admire father daughter bonding...Hats off to acting of team involved... Just watched this movie, dont\' judge this one by the cover the trailer does it no justice i was glued to my sit. I made popcorn twice! This movie is one of the greatest alien movies i\'ve seen in 2000s long time Im very proud of zach dean and the cast was great. Highly recommend this one It\'s an extraordinary film. Loved it. Great script. We have to prepare ourselves for the future. We don\'t know what\'s lying there for our kids. This is the best movie I have seen in a while.  Starts out odd but stay with it.  5 STARS This movie was sooo entertaining. I highly recommend watching this. Man the action in this was A+! Especially the first contact, even with 500 round magazines with gasoline bullets which normally takes me out of the moment, it was the most intense movie shooting i\'ve personally ever seen.. (second is from ""sabotage"", which had a really boring story sadly) Recommend this to everyone! One of the best movies I have ever watched   Absolutely amazing 10/10 This movie is fantastic, great action, effects and sound! Love it and I\'m going to see it again! ;-) I\'m very confused by the plot here, if you\'ve developed reliable time travel, to the point that hordes of people are routinely going back and forward in time (they mention that 70% of draftees don\'t return), why is winning any war hard? You literally have all of time available to learn how to effectively defeat your enemies, with minimum casualties. When I first saw the trailer I thought it was weird sending people from the past to fight for the future but possibly erasing timelines...but they actually cleared that up, impressive story. Really loved this movie! Great alien design too. Really liked how badass Chris Pratt was! - How are you so calm\n- long story\n\nRegularly protect the galaxy with a raccoon a work of art, a plot not at all obvious, full of twists, not the usual love story .. it makes us reflect on the need we have to stay together and team up, on how much we need to pull the balls out for the common good.\nI can only scream the charge that sent me ..  I just watched this movie and absolutely loved it. One of my favorites now. This movie was actually really good the ratings don’t do it justice I’m highly disappointed. This was the best movie I have seen in two years. This movie should have been watch in a theatre in IMAX. best movie of 2021 This movie is really good, one of the best I\'ve seen in awhile Just saw it for the 2nd time and it was still a very good movie.  Makes me want to make peace with some family members. I passed on this for ages because I thought it looked lame. It\'s actually a BADASS movie. It\'s bloody epic, funny and thrilling. Seriously surprised. I enjoy it a lot! Better than expected, brings back good vibes of how movie use to be. I am glad I gave it a chance and didn\'t listen only to the negative reviews. 1000/10 THIS IS SO GOOD AND I LITERALLY CRIED AT SOME SCENES I loved the movie .  Loved the fathers\' interactions. Good fun too. I enjoyed this movie, was pleasantly surprised. Don\'t overthink while watching and you\'ll have a good time. It was surprisingly good and father-daughter relationship was exceptionally sentimental! Watched the film liked it. I liked the action, it made me tense to see who was going to get out. Liked the message in it and that there wasn’t any ridiculous ideologies thrown in like sadly the way marvel have gone. \n\nthe only thing that was an actual annoyance was the volume. The dialogue was way too quiet versus the sound fx, music etc. Such an amazing movie worth seeing again, again and again - everything about it was good Just saw this movie and in my opinion, it’s probably the best 2021 movie so far. Finished watching it 6 minutes ago. I give this film a 7/10. Very good actors, action and narrative however, their was too many “what if’s” because their was ALOT of things the main protagonist could’ve done differently and more effectively (Very little limitation on what was physically impossible and possible) You’ll know exactly what I mean if you decide to watch it. Good Directors who make action movies are supposed to narrow down the possibilities of what could have happened in order for the viewer to comprehend and understand the motive/decisions of the main protagonist Highly Recommend!!!!! Highly Recommend!!!! This movie is Really F\'ing Good no matter what critics will say. Amazon needs to work on their UI tho! This movie got released today and it was not on their homepage of the prime video app, I had to search for the movie. You need an overhaul of your app and algorithm. Just finished watching it. One of the best movies I ever watched. This movie was intense af but it was really good !!! Cried, laughed, and held my breath the entire time I expected this movie to be a basic action movie with a big name for box office $. But I was surprised by this movie.\n\nIt’s not really anything I’ve seen before, strong storyline, strong writing, strong acting. You can’t always predict what’s going to happen next. Which is a very hard thing to do nowadays. ""How are you so calm?""\n""Long story..""\ncassually petting a raptor Absolutely loved this movie!  Perfect quarantine escape  Theories that seem reasonable:\n\n- The answer as to why they don’t go back further in time will be that you can only go back to when time travel was invented and it just has. I just watched the movie. This is a must see.\nThis is like Interstellar and Edge of Tomorrow had a baby and it\'s amazing. I really hope it explains why they go to the future instead of just warning everyone and having 30 years to build up armies and weapons. Good movie I liked the commentary when the dad and daughter witness the aliens attack the planet while flying around in a helicopter. It was something about how they don\'t need government or money to survive: They\'re just hungry. It really put things into perspective about what\'s actually coming for us, minus an actual alien invasion. By far one of the best movies I’ve seen in a long time! Bruh, gotta say this movie was one of the best i ever seen. Aliens looks super realistic.. Keep you up the chair from the start of the movie. 10/10! Great movie. If you like movies where you can just enjoy big action and mindless fun, this is perfect. Would recommend for sure. Surprisingly amazing! Best sci fi movie for this year. Recommended! When they warn humans that an alien invasion is coming, doesn’t that alter the future already, they should just prepare for it right? I wish they added another 4 hours. This film is so good When I saw this relationship between father and daughter in this movie, suddenly tears had come out of my eyes. I have cried a lot of times after watching this movie. the first time, I couldn\'t have control over my tears.. This movie will be remembered for a lifetime. Love You too much sir. Chris party ( dan forester and Yvonne strahovski ( muri ). Muri, you are great daughter. just finished it about 10 minutes ago. a definite rewatch for me. solid 10/10.\n\nEdit: stop bashing me bc I gave it a ten. Sure the family side-plot was cringe, I agree with that, but u don’t need to take it out on me. Sheesh u can never have an opinion on the internet. I just finished watching this movie. I really liked it. Ignore all the critics guys. Haters are always gonna hate. This movie will give you edge of tomorrow and Starship trooper kinda feel. Enjoy I loved this movie so much. I already watched it twice. I kno how it is. I\'m also a father. I will do the same thing for my daughter...  really worth watching, 2hrs is not wasted I just watched it and It\'s insane..the action and drama I will give 10/10.. This movie was the best among the rest! The golden lesson here is, we make out future into present! I would like to thank the Directors, and to those peole who made this Movie! Hands down! Just finished watching it and man what a great ride it was! Enjoyed the hell out of it JUST GOT DONE WATCHED AND ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THIS YEAR SO FAR️ The comments here pushed me to watch it \nI can assure you it\'s masterpiece \nA solid 11/10 At last an actual movie this year where they DID NOT sacrifice budget, to look like it\'s a B MOVIE. I enjoyed this movie a lot. The aliens were total badass too. Gee, you think he\'ll run into his daughter in the future and later finds out that the people of the future will mislead why they\'re fighting? I hope I\'m wrong and I want this to be good but looks hella predictable. Awesome movie and finally a science fiction movie that\'s just pure fun and a complete story with no b.s sequel set up. WOW, WOW, WOW! This film does have an original and creative concept, and since it has already been released in my country, Colombia, and everyone who has Amazon Prime Video is watching it. I will see it and I think that if it is good and it is a success, surely we will see a sequel next year or in 2023 maybe?. This is the first time in my 30 years  that i watch a movie about aliens and all that future stuff,and I really liked it. I wasn’t expecting to be this good The movie wasn\'t that bad, the character design of the aliens were awesome. Chris Pratt\'s performance was really good, the concept was interesting, and the action sequences were amazing. Highly recommended this if people just want some summer blockbuster movie. The writing could\'ve been a lot better tho, still it\'s a fun enjoyable action movie to watch I Love this cast, Chris Pratt, who doesn’t love him? I looove him! J.K Simmons looked AMAZING, he is ripped. I googled, and he got in amazing shape for a different role. Wow! He is an amazing actor. I loved his character in this movie. In the end, I though, noooo, please don’t kill him! When Pratt’s character saves him, I was so relieved! This movie surprised me. The special effects were spot on. ️. Great movie!  Just watched the movie, and oh my gosh, it’s awesome. One of the best movies I\'ve seen all year loved it My family and I loved this movie, there was never a dull moment. It kept us on the edge of our seats the entire movie. We laughed we cried all around great movie... I finished watching it today, SUCH A GOOD MOVIE!! Very entertaining. One of the best sci-fi movies. Highly recommended. I saw independence day and stargate back in 96. Ever since that for years I\'ve been saying that\'s the best Sci fi movies ever. This one is a contender. Those aliens were giving out orders in a fight. One tear off its arm to stop the poisoning and much more incredible witty moments there. The best way to end the Terminator series would have been going to the future and winning the future war. But no, they insisted on wrecking the classic T2 and then this proves that a good ending could have happened.\nLooks good. I would have watched it anyway but Chris Pratt makes it a must see. This movie is gold !!! Definitely exceeded my expectations ! This movie was really great! it left me with so many questions. But at the same time that is good. I am so looking forward to the second one. I can\'t even put into words how amazing this movie was . Best movie of the year so far . I laughed , i cried,  i kissed 2 hrs & 20 mins goodbye.   Saw the movie! Emotions are everywhere on the movie. Probably the best movie since World War Z. Just watched the movie it was amazing needs a part 2 ""Conspiracy Santa""...Best Movie Line EVER!!! This movie was amazing. \nIt\'s really worth to watch 100/100 The Guardians of the Galaxy Star Lord body really has paid huge dividends to Chris Pratt. Just got done watching it!! THATS HOW YOU MAKE A MOVIE!! \nMan it was Amazing! I LOVED IT. 10/10. \nI wish I could erase my memory and watch it again . This movie was amazing. Big budget for this film to be made, very well spent, picked a great actor for this role. Didn\'t expect much from this movie and I\'m glad I didn\'t because it\'s surprisingly great. This was a really good movie.. unpredictable and very well made... monsters I\'ve never seen before and keeps on the edge the whole time. 8/10 Ive never seen alien franchise movies as good as this one. Good job 10 stars.. opps i should clap  So this isn\'t an ""Edge of Tomorrow"" sequel?, cause I feel like it totally should be. This movie was worth my evrry second. Best sci-fi movie I\'ve seen in a while. Wow this movie surprised me a great deal. Definitely worth a watch. ️ I just finished watching it was great I really enjoyed it wonder what they will do with a sequel me after watching the movie:this is one of the best sci-fi,action,time travel movie.... ️️️️ At first I thought that this was gonna be a bad movie but after watching it I will say that this might be one of the best sci fi movie No wonder 70% don\'t return if they\'re dropping them like 200m up in the sky Amazing movie a combination of classics of the sci Fi, terminator,independence day,starship troopers,the thing and interstellar!! Thank you Amazon! The first half of this movie was quite engaging. The 2nd half was basically fast and furious with monsters.\nThe story being based on Einsteinian time travel was forgivable but the logic and scientific inaccuracies really show a lack of effort went into some places where it is direly needed. I don\'t watch movies anymore, but this one was amazing! just watched it, and its in a whole another level than the movie a quite place part 2, like they really put alot of effort into it Awesome movie! Hell with the critics. Seems like no one can enjoy a movie these days THAT WAS INCREDIBLE! One of the best movies I’ve seen in a while. When Terminator and Back to the Future combines into ""one movie"" and this was it. The Tomorrow War is the result of the combination. This movie has to be the most heartstring tugger of all time. what a great movie. best movie of the year for me. beautiful exciting story, sometimes emotional with his daughter. Lots of action and suspense until the very end. Everything is in it! I have a new favorite movie. A++ I love this movie lot especially father and daughter scenes, I don\'t know why people degrading this movie. Omg I watched. I\'m buying once it comes out. Chris Pratt kicked butt as always.  This has been one of the great movies of 2021. a heart touching story between a father and daughter. really i like that part mostly in this movie This was actually a great movie, some time-travel inaccuracies, but overall fantastic to watch watched the movie just now and not a second of my life wasted. This kind of movie makes my quarantine life happy. I finished Invincible. This was pretty incredible. Whenever I heard about it all I heard is how brutal it is but it\'s much more than that. It has so much heart with The Best fucking characters and a fantastic Cast. Just heard season 2 and 3 will be a thing so I\'m excited. My review of this movie is a 9/10 in the sci-fi and acting portions of the film.  The actors did the\nbest they could with the script given.  There are a few holes in the story-line/ plot of the movie.\nRegardless, this was definitely not ""garbage pizza"" as referenced by a supposed renowned critic. Just watched this movie andjust luvd it, definitely a 10 out 0f 10! This is a re-watch definitely. The movie was so good. I like the story, the plot, the script, everything. The CGI, I thought it was great, the aliens are not that powerful but enough to scare the audience. I also love the adult daughter acting skills, I really connect to her. The ending satisfies. Actually I thought it\'s not going to be good, like boring sci-fi films with high budget however I was wrong. It doesn\'t need a sequel though, if there will be one, please make it a much better movie than the first. So this isn\'t an ""Edge of Tomorrow"" sequel?, cause I feel like it totally should be. Loved it!! Saw it again the next day cause it was so good. Now I finished.....best movie ....I am fall in love of this movie bcoz of Storyline And Epic battle scenes.....that I have ever watched.....And heart Touched scenes .....Very Fabulous..️️ THE BEST MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME. THE PLOT WAS RIGHT ON WITH THE STORY LINE AND FOR A SCIFI MOVIE. I GIVE THIS A 10/-PLUS. CHRIS U PLAYED YOUR ROLE GOOD AND THE FEMALE SOLDIER THAT PLAYED YOUR DAUGHTER GREAT ACTING BY FAR THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS AWESOME. IM SO PUMPED UP.I WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN ON REPEAT THATS HUCH I REALLY LIKED IT. IT GOT MY ATTENTION BY FAR CRIS PRATT GREAT PERFORMANCE . GREAT JOB EVERYONE. This movie is much more than a work of imagination and entertainment. It has a deeper meaning behind all the drama and fantasy. It comes at a time when the traditional family is frowned upon, when selfishness drives people to shun responsibility of raising a family and live single lives of self indulgence, when the killing of babies is being legalized, when men are looked upon as toxic, when girls and boys are told they can be any gender they choose and all the other craziness of the so called liberal left. In the end, family is the most important part of life, and that life is precious beyond measure. This movie was SO good!!! Best movie I have seen in a long time. I hate how much I underestimated it in the beginning. Well since this is an original story, my expectation won\'t be that many, just expecting a fun action disaster entertaining movie, that\'s all. I hope this movie delivers. I like the concept and the trailer looks amazing tho!! Such a good movie. I didn\'t expect this. We should uplift more unique movies like this. So the cycle of good movies continue Wait wut. \n\nThey went back in time to get people to go forward in time to fight a war that hasn’t happened yet?  Just finished watching this movie minutes ago without actually seeing the trailer and wow i enjoyed it! Man I absolutely loved this movie Totally satisfied n finally that volcano kid save everyone lives I don’t understand why this move got so low ratings. The movie was amazing!! A++ this movie, is well balance action pack good story,replay value,good job to every actor, and actress , Chris ,A++ prime Amazon keep up the good work He went through time against thanos and won, this will surely be like a piece of cake for him  Love this movie and so does my mom. Highly recommend that you watch this. Overall great action, forgettable aliens. \n1. Send the time warp technology to the past so it can be perfected earlier making better jumps and preventing the disaster at the end. \n2. How the hell could MIT scientists not realize she was emitting pheromones? Mother bee? Hello? Most animals with one female have hives.... You should have had her in a helicopter over a volcano so any of the other beasts trying to jump to her would get fried.  I LOVE this movie! i don\'t care what you people say especially negative comments, its just a movie so enjoy it :) Amazing movie, the creature design is so cool! Nice! Great story, acting, music, sound, stunts, special effects, real nice cinematography and directing! Grandpa: you tell it to die? \nChris Pratt: Yeahh... \nGrandpa: It worked..Why didn\'t you tell it sooner...  Just finished watching this movie! And it\'s the best alien movie for me!!! 10/10!!! ️️ best movie i ever seen i cant stop my tears of this movie Watched it and came here to say, it\'s a must watch movie! Thought it would be one of those cheesy sci-fi flicks (going by the trailer) but it is so much better than I imagined. Will be watching this again! I think it is far more enjoyable than most would expect. I saw this movie last week and enjoyed alot..its amazing and impressive.. strongly recommended to watch this one.. I love how this movie is just every show’s parody of a generic sci-fi. Esta peli debió de estar en cines estuvo super padre la recomiendo 100% I\'m assuming they\'ll present and explanation about why people from the past fighting a war in the future doesn\'t cause the grandfather paradox? Or is this just gonna be like Endgame all over again? this movie was absolutely amazing This movie rocked!  It was well cast, diverse, funny, tons of action and no one is confused about which team they are on. LOL Sequel? I really liked this movie. Bravo, more like it please! There are some cheesy mash up of multiple sci-fi themes in the movie, but overall, it’s worth a watch, and keeps you captivated. I swear to god this is the best movie i have watched since 2015\nAll credits,goosebumps feelings, 10/10 film Edge of Tomorrow is the most underrated sci-fi movie. The Ecpanse the most underrated sci-fi show.  Hopefully The Tomorrow War will be a quality film like those except with more recognition. I feel like this is one of those trailers that just gives away 75% of the story in advance just watched it 5 min ago, definitely recommend 10/10. Hands down to the production team has made one of best sci-fi movie. Great to see Yvonne Strahovski, Chuck was one of my All-time favorite series! Watched this yesterday with my family, surprisingly it was really good! I \'ve watched it, it\'s great! Just shows how versatile Chris Pratt\'s talent is. Apart from the aliens, the emotional side regarding his daughter and father makes a nice addition.\n\nTo those who complain that Americans don\'t watch soccer... The trailer shows the World Championship in 2022, so we can make an exception here. Someone do “The Forever War” and stay loyal to the book and I’ll pay to watch it. I found this to be the most powerful movie after all that has been happening recently.\n\nThe story of this film speaks to us in a way that truly warns us that if we do not fight to improve our world, then our children will have to fight for this world and suffer. And even die much earlier than their due time for our mistakes and inaction.  pretty much the best thriller/action/horror movie of 2021 and 2020! Besides the tv show the boys this is the first time im pleased with a amazon prime original . this movie is pretty great from beginning to end ... And I dont say that about many sci fi movies .... But this movie is awesome .. Def could\'ve came out in theaters this is the best one at this moment in this year!  loved it! perfect movie! Lot of action! Also describes problematic father - son/daughter relationship... Chris Pratt : saved the world from aliens , and was in dinosaur movies , now his next action adventure , saving the human race from certain destruction and wiping out of existence most underrated movie in 2021, it is actually best movies I\'ve seen this year so far the terminator: ""ill be back""\ndan:"" i will be back"" Surprisingly good, if your a sci-fi fan, it’s worth a watch :) 2:13 that scene man that\'s just literally the best scene of father and daughter in an action movie with that VFX it\'s just mind-blowing ive seen the movie its really good i recommend buying it! This was surprisingly a good movie! Just saw this movie. Was really good to be honest, well done OMG Yvonne Strahovski is in this? And I\'ve just finished replaying mass effect 2. Nice, didn\'t expect my girl Sarah Walker and Miranda in this movie. The third act, albeit heavily lifted from other great sci-fi classics, is very good. Good jokes, too. This movie gave me Starship Trooper vibes while watching it! Loved it! One of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen This is the best movie ever in 2021. I watched it! I cried and excited all came in one movie. US movie always the best \n\nGreeting from Malaysia! Excellent Movie. Definitely worth watching I\'d give it 5 stars. This looks great… but this should have been the next chapter in the terminator story. Just finished watching this. This is a masterpiece. I love this kind of movies,I’ve really enjoyed it,more than 2 hrs I was so entertained. This movie was amazing i recommend it to anyone who has prime I just finished this movie and I really liked it! Have to say this was much better than I thought. Very watchable and fast paced, with great cgi but it\'s far from perfect and the plot is so confusing at times. I love watching Chris prat trying to cry because it reminds me so much of Ben stiller in tropic thunder, as he can\'t quite do it lol. That aside it\'s better than a lot of films that come out of theatres and gotta hand it to amazon because they did a great job. This is just the next Terminator movie we should have gotten with Chris Pratt being Adult John Conner. This is actually a very good triller and action movie, a semi Alien vibe mixed with Avengers. Chris Pratt I\'m so hyped! Just watched it - very entertaining.  That took me by surprise a bit - I looooove science ficiton, but not the action packed type.  I never watch super hero movies, for instance - I get bored. This was not what I had hoped for, but I guess it was what I needed for a very fun watch :D - fast paced, ugly aliens, some heart felt moments. Honestly it’s like the Edge of tomorrow but better in it’s own way\n\n-Some sort of time travel is involved\n-Main character meets blonde girl 10/10 done watching today I really love it. Absolutely loved this  I almost listened to the negative comments and missed out on this 1. Great action movie. Way better than I thought ""We have a time machine, what\'s the plan?""\n""Go back in time and recruit the guy from Parks & Rec."" I just finish watching it. I lovedddd it. THOSE SCI FI ACTIONS IT\'S AMAZINGGG Okay, I\'d watch it again and again.. It wasn\'t bad. Not what I was expecting  Just watched this movie is amazing and now among the Sci fi greats This movie is super nice! Please make part 2 and 3 please!!! There are so many sci-fi cliffhangers!!! Please please please! It\'s like Ripley\'s enemies or predators came to bring the monsters to Earth, but they crash landed. But please bring back Yvonne in part 2 and 3 please! This movie just came out of nowhere wow. Good action, cgi, and creature. Highly recommended. This is the best Movie of 2021 I can tell u that  Everyone here said this movie was very good !! I\'M EXCITED TO WATCH !! Very well-made. Loved it ️ I really loved this movie. This was definitely a solid movie. Really entertaining, a lot of action, and good CGI (the aliens looked awesome). It held my attention for over two hours, so I would absolutely recommend it just watched it. this movie is my favorite movie. its amazing and very epic You mean that I don\'t have to wait 2 years to watch this in the comfort of my own home?! Очень хороший фильм!! Хотелось бы продолжения ! Overall very good movie especially the daughter father scenes. It was a good movie, highly enjoyable. This honestly makes me wonder, if a person (from the present) dies in the future, would that person be erased or just that their death would be specifically an accident death instead dying to a alien? Just watched and its a really good movie! Its worth to watch Amazing.. just finished watching it today..\nOne of the best sci fi movie i ever watch... I love how he was like ""Is this a joke?"" There’s only 1 man for this job, Burt Macklin FBI Looks can be deceiving, this movie is awesome! Not just a generic alien movie, but a brilliant written movie. Highly recommend to watch this gem Loved the movie but the pacing was off and felt like stuff was cut. I think they should have made it into a mini-series because there is so much potential & valuable content here. Very good concept. The movie was AWESOME!!!! Alright, alright, you got me with the trailer, the movie actually had proper explanation, nice one. Just finished watching this. Gotta say it’s pretty fucking underrated Just watched it. It was an enjoyable movie. There were major plot holes, though. Like if the people from the future came back with all this news, they would have also brought info about the what the creatures were like, so the world of today would have had 30 years to  prepare and create better weapons and armor. This was such a great movie. Best movie I\'ve seen this year. Finally got around to watching this. It was very enjoyable, my 10-year-old boy loved it. I\'mma give this movie a 169/100 this is beyond awesome the best 2021 movie so far, full of actions... This literally just looks like a prequel to edge of tomorrow. The aliens look the exact same I know that the detractors are hard at work but this is the best action flick I have seen in years and it is on Prime.  Wow!  I was blown away.  Chris Pratt gives an awesome performance.  Great supporting cast and doesn\'t PC you to death.  Highly recommend this.  All movies have plot holes and such, but in the end I want to be entertained.  It did it spectacularly and had us rooting for them the whole time.  I would have gone to the theaters for this one easy and it would have been a Blockbuster!  If it had come out before Covid, it would have made a ton of money. Chris Pratt\'s back must be hurtin\' Saw it yesterday....had to see it again today ...I LOVED IT... One of the best movie ever ,,,,I see this movie  it’s really fentastic story ever ,,,I love this concept and science fiction  One of my favorite time travel and alien movies! One of the best movie ever ,,,,I see this movie  it’s really fentastic story ever ,,,I love this concept and science fiction  This was actually a really good movie !! Best movie I\'ve seen in years. Best space aliens EVER. Now I see several Alien and Predator vs The Whitespikes ! Just too bad that Hottie Yvonne Strahovski dies in it. And looking forward to the sequel.  I\'ve watched it today and it\'s pretty amazing. The alien theme looked like a bit from the movie The Great Wall. I love both  One of the best movie ever ,,,,I see this movie  it’s really fentastic story ever ,,,I love this concept and science fiction  One of the best movie ever ,,,,I see this movie  it’s really fentastic story ever ,,,I love this concept and science fiction  This movie is  10/10!  Charlie’s lines throughout the movie:\n\n“SHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHIT!” Muri was a kid like us , but who knew that she could\'ve save the world one day. I\'M CALLING IT: Yvonne\'s character is his daughter in the future just watched this with the entire fam, and we really loved it! it might have started slow but the buildup all the way to the ending was great! worth watching for a two hour movie! The time travel in this movie is very similar to the one in DragonBall Super, where future Trunks takes present Goku and Vegeta into the future to help save his own timeline. Going back to the past to change the future doesn\'t work because going back to the past will automatically create another timeline. Just done watching this movie and i gotta say, it\'s a good movie Best alien fighting movie I have seen since Sigourney  Weaver’s Aliens! \nWhen a movie can keep your attention from beginning to end that’s when you know you got a hit! That was such and intense movie loveeeeedddd it!! Great original concept, really enjoyed it! Needs more Mike Mitchell. I watched it and I LOVED IT! This movie is as if Tenet moved forward like normal. The Aliens were completely overpowered from being huge,fast,shooting projectiles, swimming across the sea and gliding in the air but it was an interesting movie 10/10\n\nJust watched the movie now! I\'m breathless! This movie was way better than I thought it would be. Highly recommend! Just saw it....LOVED it! Sort of like Starship Troopers meets Pacific Rim meets Alien. 2:13 This moment in the movie was depressing.\nOther than that it is awesome action movie for an evening. Go watch it. Anyone else waiting for Emily Blunt to pop out from around the corner when they teleport to the future and she has like an eye-patch while suit-up in a robot suit and leading the human race as the Commander-in-Chief while having a deaf daughter as the second-lieutenant? Just watched this, great movie. I love time travel movies so this was right up my street. Worth a watch.  This movie is actually really good This movie is amazing  love it. This movie was amazing. Great movie,  watch it , you won\'t be disappointed . I already watch it 3 times Why are they going to the future to fight the aliens? wouldn\'t that mean that the aliens STILL show up in their present timeline? These timelines are so confusing. So many cliche\'s rubbed off on Chris Pratt from his father in law. Also a few Predator similarities I could recognise in the movie too... Which is why I dug it A LOT!!!  just saw the film and i loved it :D very entertaining Very good movie, love it. Guy : ""How are you so calm?""\nStar Lord : ""I held an Infinity Stone one time without dying. Oh and I fought Thanos before and got snapped out of existence. So yeah I\'ve been through worse."" Finished it a few minutes ago, HELL THAT WAS THE GREATEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. 11/10. When Rotten Tomatoes Critics don\'t like it, automatically IT MUST BE GOOD.\n\n;-) Done watching this great movie, and bro it\'s so intense, y\'all should watch this as well. I\'m looking forward to this. By far the best movie of 2021 so far ooh man every minute got me on edge Very nice ending, I respect that! just watched it. yvonne strahovski was spectacular in this. Great movie, loved it. However I still feel like it was “borrowed with pride” from\nthe EDGE OF TOMORROW with Tom\nCruise haha Those monsters lowkey looked like demogorgan…..lol….but this movie was sooo frickin’ good!!!! i loved itour star-lord Chris has stolen his father in law\'s line....""I\'ll be back"" and also the storyline... It was pretty darn good. No regrets, money well spent What a movie ️ Pretty Decent movie actually. Didn’t think a lot of the trailer but the comments were correct. Definitely worth a watch  Don\'t listen to the critics. Just watch it and enjoy it for what it is. It really was a fun watch for me.\n\nObviously there were scenes that made me go ""whaaat"" but overall, will definitely recommend Just finished this movie. It was very good. 10/10 Well I’m going to wait and see. Although knowing the time we live in, there should be about 5 more trailers before release. All of which will probably reveal too much of the story and mess the suspense up for me. Here’s to hoping that doesn’t happen and I can go watch a movie without knowing every inch of the plot already. Initially I feel vibes of Gantz.  It was alright watch.  Lots of CGI rich action sequences but not very exciting.   The arc of father and daughter is quite touching.  The best part of the film.    Probably better as a three episodes drama. Wow, this movie was fantastic! Chris Pratt\'s on of the best movie really enjoyed it i just watch it earlier today and it was absolutely AMAZING gonna watch it yall Future soldier: sir lets go back in time and warn the past\n Future general : no lets just bring them to the future By far the best movie I done seen this year The best Sci fi movie I\'ve watched this decade People are ""exposing"" the plotholes while forgeting this is just the trailer I really enjoyed it : ) Melhor filme de 2021  So much beter than i expected! Really worth watching! So proud of you Toya for being in this movie My cousin,I hope I can get an autograph from him  Hell yeah, I love Chris Pratt Americans watching \'soccer\' during a festival, now that\'s the real joke :D Seemed like it would just be a fun one-time watch and then you\'ll forget it, but after all these good reviews, I can\'t wait to watch this tomorrow (get it, cos tomorrow war? K I\'ll let myself out) Not a bad film, watched this film tonight with the family and it all flows from beginning to end. 9.5/10!! totally recommend. way better than I thought it would be. This movie was a lot better than I thought it was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! Literally the best movie of all my life ! Amazon bought MGM, their movies are going to be on another level. Loved loved LOVED this movie. Bravo, this movie is amazing!! Great movie, this is one of those good movies where the critics are wrong. Welp. Just finished watching it last week. I should probably manage my high expectations next time Just finished watching , good movie !  Soldier: We are fighting a war 30 years in the future.\nChris Pratt: Is this a joke?\nSoldier: No, it\'s a thinly veiled metaphor for climate change, I think. Just…go with it. This is a GREAT movie!! He literally fought Thanos, this should be a piece of cake!! I watched it last night and it is well worth watching.  Exciting and wild. After watching this movie, now I know who will play the 2022 World Cup Finals. Not what I was expecting... soooooo much better.     Great movie!!!!    I want more please Wow just finished the movie and all I can say is WATCH IT you won’t regret it Movie was what I expected it to be. Entertaining. The tomorrow war is basically edge of tomorrow and back to the future had a daughter who married a quiet place and had a baby with Chris Pratt I cant believe it only has this amount of views . It was a excellent movie This is soo good... Highly recommend.... Im speechless... I reallly enjoyed this movie actually I loved this film and I\'m surprised it wasn\'t rated R this might be the most brutal PG-13 film I\'ve ever seen Its really a great movie, 2:18mins worth it Bruh if they found a way to travel forward in time then make that jump forward accurate like jump to where the mother ship is and destroy it from the inside out or if it was created by humans found out the creator and kill them a few months before it goes live How awesome would this movie had been if they would\'ve focused on that alien space craft that crashed with all the white spikes. Tell us where they were headed and what planet did they really want to destroy. What planet did they the aliens themselves come from.  I have more question Chris Pratt only wants to be dealing with monsters. First, dinosaurs and now this. Well, it was worth the watch for me tho i didnt expext it to be this good, just watch it please and by the way this made me tear a bit Watched it last night. I was pleasantly entertained. I\'d recommend checking it out. Good movie, I did have a few problems with it but I still think it\'s worth a watch. Paramount Pictures : ""Only In Theaters.""\nPrime Video : ""No In Prime Video."" I hope they make a video game of it. Amazon should\'ve just invested on Edge of Tomorrow sequel if they wanted apocalyptic future war movie. One of the best movies in 2021 so far This is one the best movie of this year! Great movie! Very worth watching One hell of a good movie, period. Best movie I’ve seen in a while ""Remove your shirt.""\n""Why?""\n""Because we want to see some Beef cake"" Fantastic summer action movie!!! Tomorrow\'s War is about cherishing what we have right now. Don\'t think too hard about the time traveling, and enjoy the message: Thankfulness. We are literally living on borrowed time...so simple but deep. It’s a solid movie , I really recommend to watch this movie Closest thing to a live action Zergling rush since Starship Troopers! Amazing film loved it ️️ This movie is soooo badass! Get off YouTube and check it out. You won\'t regret it Great movie, they just needed bigger guns. Something like a 12 gauge in a AR platform or AA 12 with a drum magazine. Also a Beowulf AR would have helped a lot. Dan Forrester: ""I\'ll never leave this family""\nFinal Destination: Hold my beer ""How are you so calm?""\n""Long story..""\n\nu know him, guardian of the galaxy Just watched it. Worth the watch. Very rarely does a movie like this not leave you asking questions at the end. Very satisfying to watch. This movie is good. I have watched it 3 times already lol You already know the blond in the future is his daughter lol What a movie! I\'d rate it 8/10. Watch it people! You wouldn\'t regret! It really reminds me ""The War of the Worlds"" I watched it.....I’d definitely watch it again If you just stop thinking about the time paradox, this movie\'s pretty good. Wow!!! This movie was 10/10!! This film was insane loved everything about it Actually a great movie!! How do humans always manage to invent time travel just at the point of an apocalypse unfolding  This was such a good movie!!!! This was a really good movie This movie was fun, tough paradox much confuse much wow. Loved it !!! Boy I love this movie. ""Changing the past doesn\'t change the future."" This essentially appears to mean that in changing the past, you are not changing this future. You are merely creating a new future from that past, but you\'re not going to return to that future. ""If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future."" Such a good movie!! I like that this movie actually shows you the aliens unlike Edge Of Tomorrow. Taking a bunch of people from the past would alter the timeline though, since most of them die. One of the top ten Sci Fi Movies of All Time. Shockingly good. Great cast Can we get more movies like these So, taking bets that Yvonne Strahovski\'s character is Pratt\'s daughter? Instantly in my top 10 ️ Or they could go back and prep humans for the incoming war. I can loudly say that this is better than Edge of Tomorrow Well it was awesome I like it, loved it and its probably gonna be on replay Just watched it. I highly recommend it Well, Good thing Chris Pratt acted in a movie focusing on family using the time travel angle first before Vin Diesel acts one in Fast and Furious franchise with his family. This movie is one of my favorites ""Can we watch Edge of Tomorrow?""\n""No, we have Edge of Tomorrow at home""\n\nEdge of Tomorrow at home: After watching this, there must be a sequel in a secondary hidden ship or the female layout an egg somewhere else before she got killed. How emotional this movie was.. After i saw the ending, its kinda dont breath 2 vibe \nBtw the movie is great i will give it 8.5/10 This movie was awesome! finally they have cool series reason for me to re-subscribe amazon prime Two things that make no sense to me:\nHumanity from 2051 if losing a war against something that can\'t even shoot back\n\nThere are F-14 tomcats in the water by the carrier at 1:53 and tomcats were retired in 2006, almost 50 years before the carrier would have been destroyed by the aliens. Perhaps Tomcats were so boss they had to bring them back to fight these things? One of the best movies of this half year. Better than Cruella, Fast and furius or The conjuring. This was so good, watched it last night with my husband this  move  was  so  amazing  Watch it if you have no problem with:\n-The lack of blood & gore in a movie about savage monsters with tentacles.\n-Normal people  without any special powers or training jumping from the sky & still walking like a boss.\n-smack them to the wall instead of killing them fighting style. This movie is so great i watched now Is it just me or does every alien/monster in movies these days seem to come from the exact same warehouse of creature design? A movie like this was already needed Wouldn\'t that create a paradox tho? If you recruit people from the past and have those past people die in a future war then the future ancestors would never exist.  Unless you only drafted people who already had their children I suppose. Hmmm  Amazon Prime si que se lucio, estuvo buena la peli. y las espinas blancas guau estaba crypes y fabulosas Holy crap, that was a good movie I enjoyed this movie! A hidden gem..it \'s a perfect futuristic postapocalyptic movie...unfortunately didn\'t have the advertise...it can match terminator ..really thrilling from the begining to the end ...9/10 Humans do have a life-long Love of war so if it is from the future, why not I wish this perfect film to be in theaters Loved It!  Grandpa is jacked too!  WTF!  Entertaining all the way This fantastic looking movie came out on Amazon on the same day as my 22nd birthday! By the way, hello, my fellow Cancers!  Awesome movie!!! A must watch The aliens!! They sure are hungry.  The best predatory ET since Alien. Wow. This movie is so darn entertaining. Imma watch it again! ""When you got family, nothing is impossible.""\n\nWait........ Wait, they were dropping people from the sky? That\'s counterintuitive, you know. You called those people because you needed them! the first third of this movie is just terrifying but its really good. I love him so much I forgot about the pandemic  10/10 this movie is awesome The few problems I have with this movie.\n\n1) if you make a movie like resistance fall of man but in the future instead of the past then just do resistance fall of man. This movie was awsome There are so many obvious plot holes with this premise that, even if the end of the movie reveals that the future soldiers behind the draft were lying, there\'s NO way that the main characters could possibly be stupid enough to fall for this. They (and the audience) should be asking obvious questions: The Last Fight was so great!!!!! It’s basically next-generation, “Starship Troopers.”  ️ ️ ️ ️ ️ gonna rewatch it to see if there was anything I missed  This was a great action scifi movie 10/10 no messages no woke garbage just fun the movie was amazing Fan fact. This was his life before he went on that faithful journey aboard the Avalon. Honest to god right up until this very moment i thought this movie was the Chinese version of Edge of Tomorrow.\nIt didn\'t even register in my brain that that was Chris Pratt and not Tom Cruise on the cover or anything. This actually looks really good Extremely good worth watching Oh and the acting it is spectacular.  Something tells me this will happen in 2022 for real :)) Not long watched the movie.\nI enjoyed it wasn\'t mind blowing but it\'s that kind of movie you miss watching before the MCU trash came along.\nReminded me of Edge of tomorrow. Finally a movie that let the aliens won ravaging the earth . Good to see Chris reunite with his raptor friends. This is one of the greatest movie of all time...\nThat is if this is the only movie you have ever watched.\nElse this is a great attempt to make a story inspired from edge of tomorrow... It was worth watching, give it a go if you haven\'t yet, movie itself is way better than the trailer! Now I wanna see this  Fun fact the adult daughter is played by Yvonne Strzechowski, she is in the series Chuck and is also the model and voice of Miranda in Mass Effect. 10/10 loved it Chris Pratt is awesome! I’m so excited for this. Chris Pratt: I gotta save the world!\n\nWill Smith: Hey that\'s my line! This looks all right. A fun actioner. The only problem with things like “everything wrong......” and Pitch Meating” is that within 5mins of watching this I find myself going \n“Well that’s wrong, that doesn’t make sense and wait so we have time travel but we don’t have time to show a guy how to load his gun?!” Hm. As active-duty military, it’s cute to watch military wanna-be’s play soldier. I especially adore the scene where the future soldiers appear wearing what looks like body armor....and many are wearing ball caps (must be Kevlar caps, of course) and only a few have helmets. Ball caps make good protection against deadly aliens! \nA note to Hollywood folks: please employ more military advisers. There’s this five-sided building in DC called the pentagon, where these people called generals and admirals work. They know a few things about fighting. Their advice would’ve helped this movie...because to me, it looks like a comedy masquerading as an action flick. Y’all can do better...and Chris Pratt kinda deserves better stories. Thank you. That will be all, out. The movie was sooooo goodddd!!!! I loved it  seems like a pretty good movie  30% on rotten tomatoe. The woke critics hate this movie. Making it a must watch! the aliens are so OP!! they can run really fast they have protective skin they have toxic arrow things they can fly and swim and are smart have good sense of smells have good sights and they breed really fast like! excuse me can we even survive!?! Too all those complaining that this is not realistic... This is one of the few movies that actually gives logic to a decades old sci-fi horror movie fallacy. How in the hell do aliens manage to develop and create spaceships and travel through galaxies only to come here and act like predatory animals and try to kill everyone not using weapons? I just watched it and really surprised me the imaging of destroye everything and end of life on earth, I promise you will like this movie even if you are not fan of sci-fi movies. This movie was awesome  !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing movie. Looking forward to the plot holes. Ok so we have a future atleast till 2051 and the atmosphere also looks fine the ending was meh, but some scene with Dan and Muri were tear jerking for me, especially when he back from future and see his daughter in her sleep with regret The BEST Movie of the Year!!!!! Very very very worth watching! My thoughts after the last few scenes""What if there are people that save the world from aliens and we just dont know i\'ve just watched it..FANTASTIC!!!! well i guess this movie should be seen on Father\'s Day.. I felt somewhat amazed in the scene where it showed flags of nation on the pole which were on the forefront of technology and power and world leaders... As far as I can remember I saw South Korea , China , Germany , Russia , Usa & UK...... I mean I hope my country was there too but I got goosebumps seeing those world leaders flags there !!! The setting makes zero sense but seeing yvonne in a futuristic story is always good. I hope they dont focus on making the story more complicated than they can handle and instead make the action epic. This movie was surprisingly great! No bs ONE OF THE BEST ALIEN MOVIES I\'VE EVER SEEN.A MUST WATCH FOR THOSE WHO LIKE GUNS AND SUSPENSE Wait a minute... If they travel to the future to fight some aliens that invaded future earth, doesn\'t that mean that ,when they\'ll win and return back, the aliens will still invade them ? It\'s like underworld meets resident evil and had a baby called doom; all three together is this movie and it\'s really awesome a must watch Amazon did well with this one  Have you ever wanted to see all those great Sci-Fi films but you just seem to never have time to? Well now you can get all those films rolled into one with a script written by a piece of computer software.\n\nYou Get: ""Sir. If future people can make time travel possible, why dont they make some Robots and fight the aliens. If they can make time travel work, robotics ain\'t that hard""\n""Son, time travelling robots ain\'t a good idea""\nterminator music intensifies To sum up this movie is like a family reunion in the end Probably the BEST MOVIE that has come out this year thus FAR!!!!!!!!!!!! Awesome movie... loved it Just watched this movie with my little fam and OMG it was soooooo good!!! Exciting and action packed from beginning to end, tear jerker for sure too.  Definitely a MUST WATCH!!! GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME !!!!! Looks good! Screw the critics The trailer looks like another typical fantasy war movie. Before I watch it, and putting aside that most of you love Pratt, please rate this for me before I watch it.\nThanks. Excelente excelente excelente pelicula! really liked this movie! humanity can control time but we can\'t destroy bugs. Scyi-fi <3 Amazing movie!!! This is a job for the Guardians of the Galaxy. This movie has some cool fights like the fast pace kind in world War Z couple characters were a bit annoying but I would  watch this again. So, where is the TVA? Protect the sacred timeline. Watched it and thought it was alright. I looked past the plot holes for the action. The future humans should have started a campaign for the present humans to, ""Make Love, For War."" a plot that a 3 year old could follow,  and holes in the story line that you could drive a Mack truck through.   It is really entertaining though ,  with great CGI effects.   My wife really loved it ,  She gives it 3 stars ,  I give it 2 1/2 stars .  I might even watch it again.  Anyone who enjoys action filled sci-fi type movies will like it I\'m sure. The best movie for sci-fi This movie reminds me of:\n1. Edge of tomorrow\n2. Starship troopers \n3. I am legend  Woooooooooooooooow just watch it.. Fantastic movie long time no see good exciting movie like that ""Is this a joke?"" My thoughts exactly. This movie had like 5 or 6 ways to end it and leave the viewers happy, but it just never ended! Towards the end I’m thinking, “okay it’s about to wrap up I can tell from the way they built up the scene”, nope. The ratings are BS! this movie is gold! EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!! DEFINITELY  from me! You know it would have been more interesting if they had come to the conclusion that the whitespikes were not aliens but from earth. After the volcano eruption they somehow were born there and lived there for thousands of years until the ice started to melt and they had to come out. If it were possible to time travel I believe they would have gone to the 1930\'s or 40\'s for help. Is it just me or does the music in this trailer sound weirdly similar to the one from Black Widow? The idea that this someday might come true is insane to me... all these movies lately have been giving insane messages lately. I hope if aliens do reveal themselves they’re allies. Take notes Hollywood. 100% AWESOME.  Just finished the movie.  Funny,sad,action, and drama. Sci fi enjoyment.  Take notes Hollywood. I got the “edge of tomorrow” vibes from this I think the screenwriter wrote this movie specifically for a Ryan George Pitch Meeting. Plot holes are tight! Yvonne Strahovski is really cool in this movie.  Why wouldnt you continually bring back tech like 50 years in a loop until your tech was so far superior to your aggressors that you win easily?\n\nReally wish this was based on the novel Forever War (which i first mistook the title).  5 stars!\nNetflix movies, time to upgrade! Oh yeah, this trailer has won me over Just saw the movie, thought it was pretty good. Did think it felt slightly similar to something I\'d seen it before, then suddenly remembered an episode from love, death + robots season 1 called the secret wars. Anyone else or just me? Ngl I found myself enjoying it more than I thought I would i saw it. freaking awesome for sci-fi movie. Its like future Jurassic Park packed with diversity and climate change, I enjoyed it. Loved the movie “Is this a joke?”\n\nJoke: Am I a joke to you? Enjoyed watching TWICE. If he played his headphones I would have watched it one more time for the music. The story plot and style kinda resemble the edge of tomorrow Actually a pretty good movie. Some cliché but still entertaining. Looks awesome! What a great movie not bad, some lines and interaction were cringy but apart from that, solid A Why do I feel like I have just watched Edge of Tomorrow all over again? If there\'s a war in the future and time travel exists why would ground combat be the only weapon against the enemy? Clearly you\'d be able to know when they arrived... go back in time and lay a trap for their arrival right? Best Movie after long time 10/10 love from Pakistan ️ Mükemmel bir film. Really good movie!! But this is why I don\'t watch previews, pretty much shows you everything ️ Why do i feel like i saw this movie 30 times already?? What a movie\nI\'m sorry it\'s long but worth reading about the movie of course ,and I\'d appreciate your attention ....The truth is that in our time we are suffering from climate change and global warming that has led to the melting of most of the Arctic ice... not to mention the presence of a movie in 2012 that talks about the Corona virus Even in some films we see that sometimes it is adapted or planned from something that will happen in the future... My question is, will after all what we are suffering now about our world, will it lead to the emergence of underground creatures, which in turn will lead to the end of humanity, according to what we know from what is mentioned in all religions that there will be a global war between humans and monsters? Is this movie just a movie or a plan and an end test? Somewhere, the Eternals are watching This movie definitely met its ""quota"" shame, it could have been amazing if they chose actors deserveing of the supporting roles. This is a true story. And we\'re living in it right now The tomorrow war was awesome Very enjoyable movie.  Sloppy ending, but as always - no writer ever gets hired for their great endings, it\'s always what hooks the audiences into watching in the first place. Better than what I expected the plot on it\'s wiki page sounds so much like Edge of Tomorrow, this trailer shows it isn\'t. looking forward to watching! Spoilers... This concept is interesting, how I understood it so far is this: You have a very long ruler, you place clipper 1 at 0 and clipper 2 at 40,000, each second both clippers move to their right by one, so after 5 seconds clipper 1 will be at 5, and clipper 2 will be 40,005. Where ever clipper 2 is, is the present for clipper 2, and the same goes for clipper 1. If someone teleports from clipper 1 to clipper 2 when clipper 1 is at 100, they will reach the other side (clipper 2) at 40,100, you don\'t teleport to a specific spot, you teleport to where ever is present for clipper 2. Great movie ️ So basically, instead of properly preparing for the invasion, people from the future just take present-day people to after the world’s already been through the majority of it all?\nI think these are the biggest lengths a movie has gone through to avoid the initial apocalypse to save budget. Am I the only one who remembered the face of ARNOLD when he said "" I WILL BE BACK "" ️ Wish there was more Mitch in this trailer. It would be wiser to go back in time and say ""30 years in the future we are losing a war against aliens. We need you to have as many children as you can and train them to fight."" Perfect Father’s Day gift 10/10 i want to forget this movie and watch it again Very worth to watch, 2hours is awesome I watched it and I loved it I suspect JK Simmons plays Chris Pratt\'s character when old, and Yvonne Strahovski plays his daughter in the future. Wait why would you bring people from the past to fight for the future? Why not just bring people fighting in the future back to build up defensed or bring technology so they can be even more advanced by the time they got to that point? Yep, when the fate of the whole world depends on info about volcanoes, I don\'t go to a volcanologist at one of the top universities, I go to a 12 year old boy who is crazy about them. Ah yes, a war where you can\'t even give a day to train someone how to sue a weapon, and you murder 9/10 of your solders right out of the gate by dropping them over a city skyline. How asinine. Excelente pelicula!!! Carajo !!!! Just watched it 2 min ago. Great entertainment!! I hope one day someone will take the time to edit the movie and replace the aliens with xenomorphs. Loved the movie F the people who are hating on the movies, this movie is really good The movie aliens literally reminds us of gog and magog. Like we see in the end, they are under the floor for thousands of years. Chris Pratt, Yvonne Strahovski (where\'s our ""Chuck"" reunion, dammit?!) J.K. Simmons and Betty Gilpin (who is great in ""GLOW"" btw. If you have Netflix I strongly recommend watching that show.)? Yeah, I don\'t care what the critics say, I\'m totally watching the $#!+ out of that movie. Fortunately it\'s sitting at 52% on RT, which I consider a rounding error. Amazing film 5 stars This is the best popcorn movie I\'ve seen since Infinity War ... I wish this movie was on Netflix instead of Amazon Prime video. This is the best movie I ever watched this year. Fun to watch, completely derivative from movies such as A Quiet Place, Aliens, The Great Wall and so forth, and follows a hackneyed ""push every Hollywood button."" The final battle is utterly ridiculous. But think of it as a vacation for the brain and enjoy its scenery and effects, and there is a place for that sometimes. Won\'t drafting soldiers from the past means less soldiers available in the future when the aliens do actually attack? This movie was a great story line great actors but had too many cheesy scenes . Great potential but this is what when doing the most goes wrong is Probably the best Sci fi movie I\'ve ever saw... one of the best for sure! There must ALWAYS be a scene where some member of an elite squad rappels or jumps into the kneeling \'\'combat ready\'\' position or the trailer won\'t be any good! This is the \'\'super hero\'\' stance when landing on earth or some platform made for the shot. \nALWAYS. This should have been Terminator 2\'s sequel scenario, not the cheap Dark fate. And Chris played alongside Arnold\'s T-800? that would be gold It was awesome! I had to stop watching this movie cause I was having a panic attack  10 out of 10!  Watching it now on the firestick.. awesome so far A perfect representation of Call of Duty ads....""there\'s a soldier in everyone"" Plis amazon and skydance make a sequel, this has potential !!! Just watched it was reallyyy good Despite its TV movie vibe, The Tomorrow War actually looks quite interesting! That black woman who enters the  football ground to make the announcement  really suited her role. Her voice is amazingly powerful and she did that very well. I really appreciate the fact that all trailers are the same nowadays, all films look and sound the same and also that they basically shows the whole story in 3 minutes, so I have a lot more free time! The movie looks nice and I\'m going to watch it today, but makes not much sense, if you can go back to the past to recruit people, why not go back and start to prepare for the war instead? Lol... Comment based on the trailer, let\'s do watch and see... This looks great. This is the best movie i have been seen before in 2021!\nMy comment:every things perfect!People is handsome,high quality and effect I came here for some Mr. Slice. This trailer needs some Spoon! The music for this trailer is almost identical to the music in the first Black Widow trailer. The Colonel is also the lead scientist, which happens to be the daughter/partner of the lead character. This movie was Awesome... To be honest, the premise is as bonkers as Pacific Rim. They are both fun to watch too So similar to Edge of tomorrow, but I highly recommend it Apart from “ wokeness “ off the roof, it’s general a good movie The trailer should immediately explain the giant apparent plot hole that is : ""we need you to fight in the future"" instead of ""we\'ll train you now to win in the future"" 1:26 did they really just throw them down, im pretty sure people die from falling from that height. They never change mags or run out of ammo, also the box he put the glass tubes never broke lmao I cant wait for 30 years in the future when endless magazines come out!!!!! Yow Chris is in the movie you know its gonna be good this movie is so underrated, i dont know how,but they keepin me intense for hours I saw a lot of good previews for different movies and the end of this video. Does anybody know the names of them because they don\'t tell you which movies they are. I would like to watch them. Thanks. This could be the survival guide to what the government knows is coming.\nYou never know He\'s my favorite Chris!  Star Lord! Even a panzer 2 would have been highly potent.\nThis is what happens to a world without tanks. I just saw the movie it was so good and especially the end man so emotional the part where they go to the nest is like a cod misson GREAT MOVIE! Wait, if you bring over thousands of cannon fodder from the past, aren\'t you just ending extended family trees and erasing even more soldiers of the future? Future people: ""We need you to come to the future to fight.""\nMe: ""Bring your people back through time like you did at the soccer game and we\'ll all prepare for the start of the war together, when we\'re not already getting our azzes kicked.""\nAlso: Men will be in charge. excelente pelicula This is the one of the best movie They have the ability to go to any point in time itself and yet their strategy is to just throw more cannon fodder at the aliens like it\'s Warhammer 40K. I kinda wanna know more lore about the aliens, the actual aliens not the ""cattle"" if you know what I mean Movie is excellent.\n2022 hero tell her daughter i will be back and goes to 2050 to save the world for future.what a fantastic story tells.i enjoyed a lot.\nThanks all This movie would have turned out a whole lot different if the Doom Slayer would\'ve shown up The most fictional scene in this entire trailer was an American family watching soccer Producer: "" What if \'Edge of Tomorrow\' was told in reverse? "" \n Amazon : "" That doesn\'t make any sense."" \n Producer:   "" And we cast Star-Lord in it.  ""  \n Amazon dumps a treasure chest on the table:   "" Take ALL the Money."" I\'ve never seen anything like it. very spectacular. it\'s been a long time since we\'ve filmed normal science fiction! and it\'s also a good horror movie! it is not clear why such a low rating of 6.4 is at least 8 points! this is a film for entertainment as a facet of the future, and for the horror of a stranger and strangers. good acting, great special effects, an interesting script! and from the beginning to the end, everything was laid out on the shelves and did not make Santa Barbara out of it, which is very rare these days! I swear to god this is the best movies i have watched since 2015\nAll credits,goosebumps feelings, 10/10 film Why would present soldiers go to the future? \nThe future soldiers should be coming to the present with their tech to prepare for the attack in that present timeline to avoid the future events. It\'s weird seeing starlord living such a simple life now. I mean if you’re going to drop people from the sky like that when you transport them to the future, of course 70% won’t make it. I’m not gonna lie, this is like Tom going to the past to tell himself to study for his test instead of giving himself the questions Even if the film doesn’t explain why they can’t just stop the war from starting in the past, it still looks like an incredibly fun film to watch. This was a VERY good movie! It wasn\'t preachy, the graphics were very good, the aliens looked so friggin cool and the story line wasn\'t predictable that it took you out of the movie! Plus I got to see Chris Pratt shirtless a few times, so it\'s a definite win! ^_^ Ever since guardians of the galaxy, no matter what Chris Pratt\'s role is, ""So he\'s an idiot"" from war machine just keep repeating in my head I don’t understand why this move got so low ratings. The movie was amazing!! ""How do we win this war?""\n""Drop in people from the past with no armour, no helmets, and no context."" So the time travellers go to the past to draft soldiers for their present war (30 year time difference) in a way that is incredibly rushed even though they have 30 years?\nAs opposed to:\n - drafting and training soldiers in effective strategies for 30 years. I honestly hope that they will make a game out of this movie. I would definitely play it. Gotta love them aliens invasion game Rapaz acabei de assistir esse filme e que filme porreta do cassete, as criaturas muito bem feitas. Vale apena assistir mil vezes. It looks like 70% of the Draftees die on actual insertion not combat. Its a movie.. everyone has there opinions. After watching I can say I  was really entertained. I would hate to go through life with a critical eye just to nock something that tons of people help make and worked hard on in doing so. The movie is free with ur prime subscription. Dont be a bitch and appreciate what u have. It was fun! Congrats to all that made it. Cheers!! So, Edge of Tomorrow meets War of the Worlds. I don\'t mind, love invasion and time travel films anyway. Honestly, \nI feel like every Chris Pratt movie is just action, action and action You know it\'s a sciencefiction movie when you notice the United States reaching the finals of the World Cup Football Just a minor little thing about the premise, if you recruit from the past, this would change the ""present"", you\'re recruiting the (grand)parents of the people who were lost or survived in the war so far, entirely altering who exists or doesn\'t in the ""present"" and the events leading to the situation in the first place. This looks like the kind of movie you watch with a friend while drinking beer just to laugh at it So, the future has time travel, and they go back thirty years, and rather than spending thirty years building up in order to be ready for the threat, they are instead just planning on drafting more soldiers? Seems like a solid plan to me. ""Let\'s send our technically less advanced soldiers and personnel, who are potentially ancestors to important figures in that so-called future, and let them fight against superiorly armed enemies. Surely nothing will go wrong""\nAre writers or directors even trying at this point? What kind of moron would send hardware and manpower into the future where even their strategems are probably obsolete. Somewhere in the background there\'s a Tom Cruise just dying on repeat. Imagine discovering time travel and still getting clapped by alien spiders Best line ever: ""I\'m just trying to save my daughter, if I gotta save the world to save her, so be it"" so serious....... This looks like a movie where I’ll be constantly hitting the ‘advance’ button so I can skim through the high points and see how the plot resolves without unnecessarily wasting an additional 80 minutes of my life. Honestly I think this looks like really good movie. It\'s a different concept that I can get on board with, PLUS the most important factor.. They can go back in time and instead of restarting the fight with a advantage, they drag people into the losing timeline Just finished it, and it was awesome.  Highly recommend, if you\'re into alien invasion,  Starship Troopers type of movie Tom Cruise shows up:\n\n""This isn\'t the first time we\'ve had this conversation."" This movie is gonna rock! I love Chris Pratt as a military veteran character. He has the persona and does a great job at it! ️🇨🇦 CHIMO! 2nd Canadian Division, 34 Canadian Brigade Group, 34 Combat Engineer Regiment, 9th Field Engineer Squadron, 2012! So like, if Endgame taught us anything, then Chris Pratt going forward in time to fight the aliens isn’t going to stop them from still coming into HIS timeline, right? Gotta say I do like the concept of being drafted to fight a war in the future, nice twist.  I love Chris Pratt so that\'s a plus. I already have so many questions about timelines and which time of time travel they’ve chosen. However this looks like simple and spectacular entertainment so I’ll probably watch it anyway. Edge of Tomorrow was really awesome and I loved the ending...when Emily Blunts asks Tom Cruise ""what do you want?"" And he just laughs back and the track plays..""can you love me again...?"" Let me guess the girl he’s fighting with in the war is his daughter in the future. You know that ""Future Blonde Exposition Lady"" he meets will be his daughter all grown up and he sacrifices himself for her... Guy: ""Why are you so calm? You ex-military?""\nChris: ""Long story. My biological father is literally a planet and I killed him."" this looks really good im excited for this. It doesn’t matter to me if the movie is good or not. Im gonna like it just because it has starlord EHEM i mean chris pratt in it Why do I have to wait until July for this?! This cast is fire! When Starlord made his way to time travel but without the Avengers. The future: we have time travel technology\n\nAlso the future: we need help and need to build an unexperienced army with outdated weapons technology. Looks pretty good.  I\'ll support most anything Pratt does.  Think he\'s awesome The plot twist will 100% be him fighting alongside his daughter\'s future self. This looks awesome. And Chris Pratt is awesome in every movie he is in. Cris Pratt el mejor actor ... que emocion tengo que verla I’m here after I just watched the movie great movie 10/10 Her: “ We’ve come here from 30 years in the future “\n\nDoc and Marty: Hold my beer The movie was really good..I am really entertained . I am quite selective on movies I include on my top ten list of best movies I have seen but this one got the spot. The movie doesn\'t only focus about alien invasion but also family matters and the reality of how people reacts in times of crisis.hmmm.. I love how inventing time travel is easier than waging war against an alien enemy when war is humanities greatest craft. Finally a scfi with a fairly fresh idea. I will definitely watch this. A movie that actually looks good  I just finished watching this. And came here to say that it is worth to watch. The best Why take people from the past into the future? Wouldn\'t you risk damaging your future, because of all the people from the past dying? So certain family lines would die out, certain important people would never possibly be born. Wouldn\'t that actually make your battle harder? Then if you had fed information to the past. Known weaknesses, formations, tactics, effective weaponry, having them doing military build-ups in anticipation. You do thiz,but you can\'t beat edge of Tomorrow ️\nThat is another level!! I love how in every movie with time-traveling plot there\'s always ""there\'s no time"". Meanwhile they have literally all the time. Technically the best trailer so far of action film when we don’t know what really they are fighting against with. How many clichés do you want?\n\nAmazon: ""Yes"" This will be the one of the best movie in 2021. ️️️ ""Fight The Future to Save The Past"" love this films concept. reminds me of Edge of Tommorow. Looks pretty damn good! ""we need more jan michael vincents in the future sector""\nSeriously though, this premise is odd as hell. \nWhy wouldnt they (since they can time travel) travel back further, and spark a faster tecgnological advancement in humans to make it so that the aliens, robots or wizards or whatever are an easier fight? Great actor, you know you\'ll enjoy the movie, good plot or no plot lol. Chris Pratt dramatically fights his way through a sea of aliens to finally meet their leader and mutters 3 words: ""Dance off, Bro"" The world is saved. I still think that Chris Pratt should be the next action hero like the good old days with Sly, Arnold, Eastwood, etc. Keep them coming, I like that guy! A better strategy would be ""over the next 30 years, humanity is tasked with reproducing and training a new generation of soldiers to prepare for the invasion"". What use is a greenhorn who doesn\'t know not to point a loaded weapon at a someone he doesn\'t plan on shooting? I just have one question... why does it need the time travel angle? If there\'s an actual, plot-relevant reason, then that needs to be in the trailer. Finally, an original story from the movie industry! I must be in the future too! Calling this now, Sam Richardson will make this movie. He\'ll be like Korg in Avengers. ""We\'re from the future, and have badass time travel equipment.""\n""So why do you need us armed with just a bunch of pea-shooter M4 rifles?""\n""Because instead of developing armies of killer robots, death ray artillery, and alien bug spray, we spent our budget on the time travel equipment."" Pratt is my guy I\'ll have to watch . Even if it isn\'t good it will with Chris,  he can make any movie good. Honestly, I feel like every Chris Pratt movie is just action, action and action I love the fact that Richard Splett is in this one No matter how bad the movie might end up , always a fan for SciFi movies.  I’d be more excited to see this if it got a theatrical release Wouldn\'t the smarter move be to lay the groundwork for better defenses if you were able to move back in time 30 years rather then conscript folks? Let\'s just hope he doesn\'t get all emotional, and ruin everything like he did with Thanos.. ""Should we send our smartest scientists back to 1900 so they can spend 100 years preparing for this war????"" ""No, let\'s just take a bunch of teachers from 2020 and teleport them into the sky above a burning city."" ""Good idea sir."" ""Sometimes a man does what\'s best for his family, and not himself""\n\nI\'m going to remember that for a while... Great, another throw away action sci-fi movie.  10/10, will definitely watch. This is epic Finally, A movie with a NEW idea for the Plot! Wouldn\'t this make more sense that a small group of soldiers from the future jump back to warn the past so they could defend themselves properly?\nFor example reveal the lead was eventually stranded in that future learning its a parallel earth and the only way to save his family was to insure that parallel doesn\'t become his Earth\'s future? ""In the future, we are invaded by an alien race which destroys mankind!""\n""Oh, so you came back to warn us and help build up defenses against them while we still have numbers on our side and a fully armed and operational military?""\n""No, fuck that, I\'m taking all\'a you guys back with me!"" This movie is missing the action sequence set to Blue Swede’s “Hooked on a Feeling,” Rocket, Groot, Drax and Gamora packing heat, and the Raptor Pack running with Chris Pratt on his motorcycle.\n\nOtherwise, it looks pretty good. ""70 % of drafties do not return""\n\n""Yeah how about we just, I don\'t know, just prepare for invasion... no need to send us die in the future ok?"" Exelente Pelicula\nExelente Produccion Ejecutiva de Chris Pratt Okay, for those who are complaining about sending past people into the future, if you listen then the woman on the soccer field says the war starts in 11 months, so nobody in a mass extinction really needs to worry about fathering any John Conners here.  They\'ve got enough time to start sending meat shields forwards to fight that wouldn\'t have existed.  Even at 70% losses, that\'s 30% more fighters than they had to begin with. I don’t understand why they would need to go “back to the future”..? Why don’t they just bring all their gear to the past? Writer: How much logic in the story you want?\n\nProducer: No If you have to travel back in time to draft soldiers to fight a future war then it\'s inevitable you have already lost. Anyone who understands time travel will know that the troops that are drafted will eventually find themselves traveling back in time... It becomes a time loop. ""This is the end. The human species will disappear from the face of the Earth. You are literally on borrowed time."" She said it like she was actually the sociopath who would say it in that mono-tone... very intense. So if you get drafted to fight a war in the future and die what happens to your past?  Wouldn\'t the enemy then have an easier time in the beginning of the war? Have so many questions like:\nIf their ancestors die would people in future disappears if so are they taking only infertile people?\nAlso why would they even bother going to the future when they are gonna face the same enemy in their own timeline?\nI mean even if they kill enemy in the future the enemy is still gonna be alive in the present since it hasn\'t happen yet. Love the movie . Humans faceoff the next best enemy after Thanos Amazon: ""You got a movie for me?""\nProducer: ""Edge of tomorrow but funny""\nAmazon: ""I\'ll take your entire stock."" It could make for a good video game, providing it is developed by large and experienced company that is heavily invested in making it. Also providing there isn\'t microtransactions/lootcrates/gambling mechanics/ general shitty greedy business ideas. Minute 1 = I might watch this movie.\nMinute 2 = I will definitely watch this movie. \nMinute 3 = I just finished watching the whole movie. Gonna be superhit ️ I like how the guy chris prat helps with his rifle is wearing camo, and chris prat is still dressed like he is getting ready to say something about how to train your dinosaur... They should have gave him a Hawaiian print shirt with pineapples and hand grenades print if they really wanted to seal the ""He a veteran"" who just got drafted and is left to outfit himself theme LOL Possible twists: He\'s an alien. His daughter is part of the future resistance. His daughter sent back the others to recruit. He\'s an escapee from the future and has already done it once. He is the bearded dude in the future and has long been informed. You know, I like the concept. People have been critizing it, saying it doesn\'t make sense but I still like it. They\'re saying that the previous generation is better than the current or future one. I\'ve always respected the generation that lived through the world war times. The generation right now are mostly obsessed with social media and cancelling celebrities. Going back in time 6 years to convince everyone that Richard Splett and Andy Dwyer are going to save the world from an alien invasion. The concept of this movie actually sounds cool yet they’ve managed to make it look generic as hell I lived through 2020 so this movie didn’t even make me flinch lmao this looks amazing! Honestly, I just want to see a movie where our modern-day forces aren\'t just pushed aside like nothing... ohh, that\'s exactly what\'s going to happen here, isn\'t it? Missed a golden opportunity for Mitch to say ""I\'m hungry...for victory."" ""If you go to the past, then the present becomes your past and the past becomes your future"" This seems like a mildly enjoyable way to turn my brain off for 90 minutes. I\'ll probs give it a watch. wow wow looks super great love it already cant wait Regardless of the bad screen writing and holes, it still looks entertaining. I agree with below his pay grade for Pratt comment, and most others for that matter Haven\'t seen this guy since guardians of the galaxy one and two.  A heart throb of  mine.  I wondered where he went.  Car hop trays from amazon. I’m already seeing all of the plot holes (I hate time travel movies for that reason) but this still looks like fun! Looks good, can’t wait This feels like one of those movies that started as a cool sounding tittle then got a story. I know it\'s science fiction, but wouldn\'t coming back to the past to change something about the future create a paradox in which the reason to why you had to return to the past in the first place never occured? Producer: So who are they fighting?\nWriter: Unclear, but there\'s explosions.\nProducer: Well alright then. I confess when I read the title ""Tomorrow War"", I got excited thinking was ""The Forever War"" from Joe Haldeman. The plot already sounds ridiculous but imma watch it because it looks cool This could be the best Sci fi of 2021 Looks awesome. Hope it does not disappoint (yes, I\'m talking about you, Solos and Jupiter\'s Legacy). Looking forward to seeing this I would rather just have a “edge of tomorrow” part two 1:03  "" You don\'t have Jokes in the future?"" \n\nInfinity Gauntlet: "" Am I joke to you?! ""  Looks all right, something new to watch and i like Pratt as an actor. This movie was bad ass. Throttle down on the board the whole time. As soon as he gets the call for MEPS, it just slowly builds until the break when he…\n\nOops… It looks worth it!  This actually looks good Future soldier: ""If we send enough humans from the past to act as cannonfodder, maybe the aliens will kill so many they get PTSD and leave""\nChris Pratt: "" I have plot armor, I\'m in"" I hope they still allow him to be funny, like \'StarLord\'.\n\nKeep up Chris Pratt. Civilians being recruited for a war in the future is definitely a fresh premise although there seems to be a major inconsistence here. If the government has tech to travel back in time why not simply send troops back to the point where the war began and simply thwart in in the root? How come drafting manpower from the past is a more logical thing to do? Love watching pratt again after endgame well i seem to be the only one in the comments who actually is pretty excited about this movie. can\'t wait to see it!! There\'s something I just don\'t understand about this premise, why the hell take people from the past to fight in a point where the war is already being lost?\nWhy not just take all human survivors to the past, and prepare for the time the war begins?\nWouldn\'t that be more effective? “I\'ll leave tomorrow\'s problems to tomorrow\'s me.”\n-Saitama ""What about the teacher\'s deferment? And the veteran\'s deferment?""\n\nBasically saying, ""And the action-star-but-also-such-a-sweet-guy deferment???"" This appears to be the love child of Terminator: Salvation and Edge of Tomorrow. I shall watch it. I guess I will give it a try. Thumbs up for Chris Pratt. im gettin that EDGE OF TOMORROW vibes. looks awesome Just once I wanna see Pratt in an R rated movie...he\'s too wholesome. i can’t wait to see this at the movies Plot twist : The people who asked them to come fight were actually Aliens ""Every time someone tries to win the war before it starts innocent people die."" ~ Steve Rogers. Don\'t care. Glad to see Yvonne is still getting roles. All that matters to me. \n\nNow. Just need to see Zach in more movies too. Maybe Shazam is getting a sequel? I am looking forward to this one. The paradox is obvious so what gives? Maybe it is a dumb pile of nonsense but maybe, just maybe it will have some thinking behind the action sequences. Best movie I have ever seen! I gotta say, this is a sweet concept. I\'ll definitely watch I feel like they could stop it from happening in the present without going to the future. ok I will watch Betty\'s shower scene in GLOW was amazing Army of today: we need more drones! Army of the future: we need more simple soldiers! Meu Deus, estou muito ansioso pra assistir esse filme, puta que pariu! This looks like a totally awesome sauce movie! this doesn\'t feel like a real movie, its like a trailer inside a movie like a parody, its like this would play on rick and mortys interdimensional television I\'m impressed they didn\'t show off the enemy so much in the trailer. Almost every other movie does. As a single, childless veteran I would be down 100% for this to be real life. From this trailer..... now i know 75% of the story Finally. Richard T. Splett is an action hero This looks insane! More back from the future movies so excited NOT Good job they drafted Starlord, he has great experience fighting aliens and saving worlds You know someone was like..what if we do the terminator movie but instead of them sending someone to the past...they go to the past and send that person to the future?!? Whoaaaaaa reverse Terminator...and the enemy will probably be some plot twist like...it was actually Republicans we are fighting I like that Chris Pratt’s shirtlessness is such an integral part of the trailer. Kudos to the marketing team knowing their audience Sure looks better than most of the cheap stuff we got stuck with through the winter. ""Why are you so calm?""  Well he fought Thanos so this should be a cake walk This is going to be best movie ever made This is awesome  I think I\'ll save my money for when Black Widow comes out. I wanna go ahead and guess that Yvonne  Strahovski character is his daughter all grown up. I think it makes sense that they sent people to the future.  Sending people to the past would cause a time paradox. It\'s like killing your father before you were conceived. It wouldn\'t make sense. But future is flexible. It can be rewritten without changing the present. You go to the future, learn whatever you can there and you come back to the present. Then whatever changes you make would simply erase the old future and create a new one. Wait Wait Wait! You mean to tell me no one weighed the positives and the negatives of sending soldiers from the past to the future, versus sending soldiers from the future to the past? They said it themselves, they have 11 months! That’s 11 months to send technology, send scientists/experts, send military, etc....Even if they themselves don’t have 11 months, this could probably be done in 2-3 months. Oh, and let’s not mention the risk they’re taking by sending people from the past to die. “Oh shit! I’m crumbling like Peter Parker in Infinity War, my Grandfather must’ve bit the bullet.”  All they have to do to win this war is strictly follow the rules of time travel. No talking to their past selves and no betting on sporting events. Aren\'t there 3 versions/possibilities of how time travel works?\n\nThis movie could still work if explained properly ️ I want to see it! If this were the 90\'s, this movie would be called ""TIME OUT"". Greatest actor in human history !  GO STARLORD !!!!!!!! ""That\'s not how time travel works."" - Hulk, Nebula. Super, ya faltaba algo de aliens, se ve buena con ese gran actor. Can wait for the pitch meeting for this movie. \n...""I bet it was really hard to get more soldiers in the future if they all died"" \n""Actually it was super easy, barely an inconvenience"" \n""Oh really how is that""   Amazon prime has come a long way in the last 5 years. Back then it had loads of content, most of it was crap C rated fliks made for streaming and costing $500 each to make. These days they are starting to give Netflix a good run for the money in subscriptions in quality content. Imagine you are one of the future soldier and your great great grandfather is one the soldiers from the past to fight for your war. You’ll have to look out for him too.  Expendable Soldier: ""Why are you so calm.""\n\nChris Pratt: ""Long Story."" Would be real cool if the plot twist was that his daughter caused the war Ok here\'s what I don\'t get. Instead of going to the past and asking for conscripts, why not just go to the past and warn everyone of what exactly is going to happen and then let them prepare for the next 30 years. The problem with what they\'ve done is that anyone\'s actions could undo whatever happens in the future meaning they may still lose despite having won. I love the concept. people in the future getting their ass whooped so bad that they have to come back to the past and recruit their great grands Can\'t wait to see how they explain away the fact there are no robots in the future to fight the battles.  Everyone knows that robots and future don\'t go together.  Or worse, they won\'t explain it at all.  Oh well, I\'ll watch anything with Chris Pratt and J.K. Simmons in it.  I\'m just wired that way. Looks like a great movie. I haven’t seen Yvonne in so long I love her work Looks cheesy, but I do love Chris Pratt.  Overall seems like a fun movie. Looks amazing I miss these type of Movie\'s ... 2 days before my Birthday  I love how he is channeling his father in law in I WILL BE BACK yknow what, if i ignore the very obvious plot holes and only focus on the visuals i think i might enjoy it, it’s looks vaguely similar to the “division” titles of game and i enjoyed that I don\'t care if it makes sense, this looks awesome. Tom Cruise could beat them all alone with Emily Blunt\'s help of course. If they did this in real life it would not work because you would have people dying which will cause mass disappearence of future people.Unless they were sent to fight in another dimension. The whole timetravel thing would fail horribly. I\'m still watching it for the action scene and the raptor trainer.  There\'s nothing like fighting aliens close to Independence Day!!! This would make an amazing video game this would be a lot cooler if it was people from all sorts of time periods. That is crazy. It teleports them on top of the highrise. The protagonist is lucky to be on the safe solid ground. Did we really need another time travel movie?! the hardest part about movies like this for me.. are the questions i have to ask myself..\nif you\'ve got time travel and you\'re from the future.. why are you pulling bodies from the past to fight? you\'ve got some seriously advanced technology and records of events, right? so you know where the enemy will be, their strengths, strategies, weaknesses.. just get that technology and information in the hands of the world\'s brightest and outfit the shit out of the world\'s military. with 30 years worth of time to prepare and build up, the enemy won\'t have a fucking shadow of a wisp of a chance. as soon as they land, they\'ll get nuked into oblivion. shit, even before they land, they\'ll be gone. reduced to atoms. Draftee: how are you so calm?\nMain Character: it\'s a long story.\nDraftee: is it the plot armor? \nMain Character: Yes... Kinda a short story I guess. Can we just for once see a movie where the aliens show up and give us some cool shit to make the earth better? ""If Ive gotta save the world to save her then Im gonna do it"" - You want some wine with that cheese buddy? Simple Just teleport everyone left in the future back to the past. \nDo this again and again until you do something that stops the alien invasion. \n\nLike A Modern remake of It looks like they put zero thought into this but I\'ll watch anything with my boy Chris Pratt 1:18 probably because he fought of Ronan in GOTG Vol.1 and his so called Dad in Vol. 2. Also he helped fight Thanos alongside The other avengers. Just a guess lol ""We\'ve got a time machine. We can go anywhere and do anything.""\n""Dude, the plot.""\n""Oh yeah, sorry."" Star Lord and Omni-Man. I dig it Draftee: how are you so calm?\nMain Character: I can\'t stop this feeling, deep inside of me Does the time portal mechanic remind anyone else of the French film Gandahar? In it an army from the \nfuture kidnaps people from the past to feed an evil entity. Because of the way the ""Door of Time"" worked it\nin a sense created two time streams, like two conveyor belts moving at the same speed. And the time\nmachine allowed them to hop from one stream to the other, hence they could ""harvest"" the past without Oh god the shining star man! I\'m huge fan of him I thought for sure it would be cheeks,  but after watching this trailer..... \nI\'m 100% watching this haha well played “We don’t have jokes in the future” - well that at least is accurate Finally a AAA alien movie that’s hopefully good. As long as you don’t think too much about it I guess. I mean an American family watching soccer? Come on. ""We are fighting the Time War against aliens""\nTom Cruise and Emily Blunt: ""Yeah, good luck with that, noobs!"" ""Our enemy is not human"" Oh no no no.. They definitely are! Also that huge ass bracelet thingy on their hands who knows what else it does.  misread and thought it was the forever war, amazing book about soldiers having travel to an alien world to fight off a threat but while they are traveling through space they age normally while decades pass on earth so when the soldiers come home the world they knew has changed drastically. Haven\'t read it in awhile but you get the picture, please read it if you haven\'t, it really makes you think. I don\'t know guys, it\'s weird trailer but looks good. It\'s diferent and something new. May be good and I\'m looking forward for it. So we\'re using the Marvel time travel idea and not the Back To The Future time travel idea. Right, cool let do this  Best laugh of the day! (or is it supposed to be a serious movie?) Why would they draft the past, wouldn’t that kill entire next generations ""Why are you so calm?""\n""I fought frickin Thanos, this is little boy stuff to me."" I like how Chris Pratt is playing a serious character not a goofball I am really surprised by the massive numbers of comments made by persons whom have no knowledge of the movie.  I just watched the movie and it is the best sci-fi movie for years.  Aliens have wiped out mankind,  the remaining population manage to get a transport device that links the population of 30 years prior - to fight for the future which are their children.  The reason you see persons falling from the skies is the transport device was damaged that caused the incident.  This is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very, very moving, graphic war scenes and monsters. The fact that they can time travel means that the humans are beyond advance, I mean just the energy it would take to rip a whole through time and space and go to the future would be humongous to say the least and to fit that amount of energy in a hand sized bracelet it just can\'t happen if you haven\'t found some miracle element or something and these guys are the ones who lost, the guys who have the means to travel through time and who have the energy to do it LOST against some civilization which is far more powerful than them so what hope does someone who can\'t even generate enough energy to colonize another planet have and the logic of this movie is all over the place they have a lot of explaining to dk Tiene sentido enviar al futuro a la gente, porque la teoría de la relatividad lo permite: basta mandarla en una nave a dar una vuelta a la velocidad de la luz, que para cuando vuelvan, ya habrán pasado muchos años, aunque para los viajeros no habrá pasado nada de tiempo.\nPero no se puede hacer lo mismo para viajar al pasado. De ahí que se envíe gente a batallar en el futuro en lugar de enviar gente a preparar la humanidad del presente. ""70% those who drafted didn\'t come back"" - damn seems legit. after i watched how they deploy to the future.. wtf they couldn\'t to give them some parachute ?? Actually a tremendous concept Wouldn’t it make more sense to prepare humanity for the future war instead of drafting them? Like go back further in time a few years, inform the world and unify them, reverse engineer Alien tech and prepare for the oncoming slaughter? Generic action movie with nonsensical plot with Chris Pratt? Heck yeah, can\'t wait! If I understand this, the show follows that things that happen in the past would not change the future. Hence the recruitment and not preparing the past for the enemy instead. This was by far the greatest Amazon original I’ve ever seen “We are fighting a war in the future and we need Burt Macklin” Makes sense that you\'d draft people from the multiverse into a military that\'s essentially fast food for your own ever expanding race. Guy before jump: why you so calm?\n\nChris Pratt: haven’t you seen Guardians of the Galaxy? We do this every time. This story\'s internal logic is nonsensical.  Getting people from the past to fight in your present war is like trying to pay down a credit card\'s debt with itself.  If anything the future peoples should come back to the past with the future tech since presumably the world of the past still has the infrastructure and manpower and therefore be in a better position to fight. So they do know that if a realitive from the past dies in the future, the entire bloodline is cut from existence. So like depending on how far into the future we\'re talkin\' that\'s like four to five people every one death. That doesn\'t sound like a net positive. Right? (I think that\'s how it works ion know.)️ Only Chris Pratt could be seriously funny when he shouldn\'t....  Imagine for a moment a friendly, benevolent alien race comes to Earth, and half the population is already dead for having traveled to the future to fight them.  Im inclined to think a resentful and fearful and suspicious population might just cause war unnecessarily. So entertaining, wish to entertain one day.....splendid... First the Infinity War, now the Tomorrow War...\n\nGive this dude a break people I think the producer should use the ""terminator"" logic, the reason why the terminator went back to the past is to prevent John Connor (to kill Sarah Connor) from ever existing, it is like sending Sarah Connor into the future and then, definitely John will not exist in that future, and second they drafted people only to be killed from falling, why not try walking through and from that same portal, they did that before the drafting Looks awesome I’ll watch any movie which includes Chris I\'m gonna need a Pitch Meeting for this one....should be super easy barely and inconvenience  They couldnt have gone back in time and tell Elon Musk to deploy some planetary defences with SpaceX instead of going to Mars?  everyone\'s comments here are on point, if people can figure out this causality loop issue why cant those writers? this trailer is doing a great job of putting people off before its even released hahahah The twist being he\'s standing beside his adult daughter during the entire mission  This time paradox thing...wouldn\'t this plot make more sense given the future army travelled back in time to just stay there and prepare to fight a future enemy? I might watch this just to see how they explain this issue lol. Cool ill definitely be watching  Nem rossz film! Nézhető, izgalmas, pörgő. Ha nem keres benne az ember sok logikát, akkor élvezhető.\n\nSzámtalan hibát, marhaságot vettünk észre, mi is, de túl léptünk rajtuk. Vasárnap koraesti családi filmnek éppen megfelelt. (kamaszokokkal)\n\nA remekül kevert 5.1 hangja pedig kifejezetten házimozi hangulatot ad! So what I don\'t get is why didn\'t they go back years in the past instead of just 11 months? Then they could have far better prepared for the invasion and had a for the most part militarized society turning the populace into a military.\n\nOr at the very least going back years would have allowed them to not only draft veterans to go back into the future with them but also give them time to train civilians into soldiers. Because I don\'t care how many men you got if they can\'t shoot or fight then they\'ll only be a liability.  1:51 that\'s CLEARLY his daughter. lol they even hint at it in the trailer. There is a scene with him and his young daughter a few seconds before we see this woman on screen. Plus they look so much alike. I get the impression Chris Pratt did not enjoy making this, just from the trailer. If they can time travel, then it would be great to go back like a minute and bring forth their best soldier at current time. \n\nWait a minute, go back and retrieve 2x their best soldier, wait a little more then there will be three to pick up.  he probably meets his daughter in the future and she\'s fighting in the war too I reckon if they all sang ""Imagine"" then everything would be all OK. Can feel a spin off of edge of tomorrow WOW NO TIME WASTED THEY JUST WENT TO THE POINT OF THE MOVIE I\'ve never seen such a pro-draft trailer in my life. Are we sure this is from 2021? Once a Hollywood actor gets a rep for playing wisecrackers they just have them playing  tiny variations of their wisecracking selves in nearly every movie. Chris Pratt is one Ryan Reynolds is another, I\'m sure there are more .. Guy : Why are you so calm ?\nChris: Dude, I,\'m the lead character and all over this trailer. pfft!! Damn looks awesome So it\'s basically Amazon Prime\'s interpretation of a an Avengers movie directed by Roland Emmerich? Yeah okay, I\'ll still watch. Wow ! Reading alot of the comments it\'s so hard for people to just sit back and enjoy the ride these days.....It\'s a movie...it doesn\'t have to make sense....it\'s about time travelling and aliens. Just roll with it and enjoy. Time to save the galaxy again, Peter! :D Awesome movie I know im yelling into the void here but this is pay grade below Chris Pratt. And that’s how he began his journey as S.T.A.R.L.O.R.D !! This is dope and very sci fi!  ooooo! Coming soon at a theatre near you,""The Day After Tomorrow War""... Ryan George is gonna have a hell if a time pointing out all the plotholes for this one Go to the future to fight a war to save the past? My head hurts already ""How are you so calm""\n""I\'m Star lord""\n""Who?"" ""70% of drafters to make it""...... If I was one of the drafties I would be pissed as hell to find out that 70% of us don\'t make it because of our stupid comrades transporting us into the sky when we time jump. ""Sometimes a man does whats best for his family""     falls from the sky Lordy, I\'m just gonna ignore the whole ""get killed in the future instead of preparing for it in the past"" thing and just enjoy a sci-fi movie that has Chris Pratt in it and the gal from Chuck. Honest Trailers is going to have a field day with this.  Damn! I missed ""Anyone could be a high budget movie script writer"" recruitment.\nAmazon please hire me! i would have liked this more if the war was 65million years in the past but winning it destroyed all the records so an individual soldier wouldnt know if he was going to return. plus our hero would get another chance to hang out with a dinosaur I had low hopes for this one from the trailer and it didn\'t disappoint. Dan Forester (Chris Pratt) and his crew of generic characters you have seen in all the other generic movies of the ilk go into the future to fight a losing war against man eating aliens. As movies go using usual tropes, adding nothing new to the genre at all, it\'s harmless fun with some good visuals, as long as you don\'t ask yourself Q\'s like they can develop time travel but can\'t make a shoulder fired weapon that does anything but piss off the aliens, and so forth. The obvious comparison movie is Edge Of Tomorrow and Colonel Muri Forester (Yvonne Strahovski) even looks like Emily Blunt in some scenes. They even managed to fit in blaming the arrival of the man eating aliens on global warming. C+ So, instead of going in the past and prepare human race to fight the aliens, let\'s go in the future to fight a war we already lose. Okay... Its always gonna be great when films are based on saving human species I can’t lie this looks lit af. muito legal There is a part 2 to the movie where Chris is unable to return to the present timeline yet earth is uninhabitable thus he travels with some survivors to build a colony in another planet many light years away from earth Relax about the plot people, it\'s an action movie for entertainment :D Twist: the time travelers are the aliens. Yvonne is Chris Pratts daughter. The world still ends. At first, I thought this was a Terminator judgement day thing. Now I see it is actually a prequel to The Edge of Tomorrow. Of course, they will discover that this is absolutely not what they pretended it to be in the first place.\n\nThe fact that they can draft people from the past suggests a multiverse. E.g. moving through times also moved you sideways into parallel timelines. Otherwise they\'d break causality. So this might me a multiverse war, and I bet the enemy is human. This looks good! Guy before jump: why you so calm? Chris Pratt: haven’t you seen Guardians of the Galaxy? We do this every time. If the recruits can keep their clothes and weapons on during the jump then I see no reason for them to have a backpack with chutes.. The Tomorrow War: A time travel dance-off competition ... featuring the Star-Lord So basically.. Starlord comes back to Earth (without his friends), starts a normal family, but then is forced to come out of retirement to fight a whole new random high-tech futuristic war after half the world was snapped back into existence? (Along with J. Jonah Jameson who grew a beard) Perfect. You know its going to have a ton of plot holes when people are already having a field day in the comments for a 3 min trailer Wouldn’t taking people from the past to die in the future just cause a paradox? The amount of creativity is astonishing  Effects: Expensive.\n\nRest of the film’s look: The best $500 ever spent on a budget. This is Starlord we are talking about so...\nI can see the ending\nAlso, First, Chris\'s Patt has to team up with aliens to save the galaxy twice. Than he must kick Hybrid Dino butt in Jurassic World, now he has to fight more aliens to save the world. Could we just think of how much hes gone through? Looks good!  Feels kind of like John Scalzi’s “old mans war” series which is truly great Sci fi. From this clip the enemy was not mentioned if they were aliens or humans. Imagine if the plot ends up when the recruited people realized they were fighting their future selves instead. And the people who recruited them were the real enemy in the future. Looks ridiculous. There are so many great sci-fi stories from amazing writers that could be done. I\'m getting the feeling that That girl who is leading the army will be his daughter...lol Looks cool. Can’t wait. \'There is still a chance we can stop this war from ever happening, so we gotta fight\'.\nWhat ?! Do you think he will employ the ""Dance Off"" or Bring a flock of Raptors to help? They should have made it into a regular series ""This is the End, the Human Species will disappear from the face of the Earth""\n\nStarlord:  Been there done that. Hold my Gauntlet Should be a Netflix thing This looks dope Excellent movie. ""Why are you so calm?"" \n""Because I\'m here to kick names and take ass."" I was hoping for a version of the Forever War Movie: Trying to up the stakes saying 70% people don’t return\nMe: Well no shit your just dropping from the sky with no parachute Army: we have come here from thirty years in the future.\nChris: stop right there I am in. Aaand they win in the end. Thanks for telling the whole story in the trailer. best action movie this year Would have been a cooler premise if humanity was forced to continually jump backward in time to survive, each time trying to prep for the future invasion but ultimately being doomed to return to a past until the right technology and people were finally able to win the battle. One media is really really very good at making trailers damn goood Plot twist: its a trap so the aliens can eat more humans since they’re running out of them in the future Wouldn\'t it make more sense if they came back in time to share technology and to build earth\'s defences to deal with the invaders when they came in the future? I don\'t know, maybe my problem is I went school. After this trailer, I had to rewatch \'Edge of Tomorrow\' to remind myself that time travel movies can actually be good sometimes. Three major studios collaborated on this and it still seems like a bore. Dang it! Gotta watch this one. Damn you Hollywood! Another reason why he should\'ve waited for spidey to take off Thanos\' infinity gauntlet  I love the concept, but why aren\'t they working with the past to create tech that can prevent this future war from ever happening? Wouldn\'t certain people dying in the past change the future anyway? That part makes no sense. ""If they don\'t draft me they\'ll draft you"" LOLL the future is woooookeee. OK, so recruiting people from the past to fight in a future war won\'t create more than just a few paradox situations? Probably best just to ignore these issues and enjoy a film.\nDoesn\'t look very WOKE from this trailer, so it might be very refreshing.  ""Why are you so calm?""\n\n""Oh come on I\'m Starlord man!"" Looks like a good brain off popcorn flick....a film to distract us from real lifes issues and just entertain us...\n\nTAKE NOTE HOLLYWOOD ISNT A TOUGH PREMISE MAKE FILMS FOR FANS NOT AGENDAS First, faceless CGI monsters. \nSecond, expect foot soldiers with ARs to changing planet-scale warfare is like expect Starlord to beat Thanos in a 1v1 fistfight.   Even if aliens happen to be peaceful, we will find a reason to pick a fight with them... plot twist: the woman is his little daughter and in the future he will make the donkey sound and she will be like ""daddy? is you?"" Would it better to send soldiers into the future to stop that war or to spend time basically preparing/training to fight. And would it become a loop etc. do many philosophical questions lol Forget time travel tech, I want those camera angles in live football match. Why  is everyone hating on the logic of sending past soldiers to the future.\n\nIsn’t it obvious there is some reason or way they will explain to us the reason for such a seemingly dumb choice? This looks pretty cool. What happened to the old days where I could watch a new movie in the theater? The plot twist is astronomical. Just watch Reminds me of early 2010s movies. Imagine if something like that happened in real life: soldiers who said they were time travelers.\nYou know how they would really be met? With cops, militia, SWAT and National Guard. This is where the fun begins MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!! GREAT MOVIE. Looks great. I don\'t mind the plot to this \n\nBut if they manage time travel than i was hoping for something like super humans being put in a science lab to come out with super man powers and other shit like that ""30 years in the future"" So let me guess, Yvonne Strahovski character is Chris Pratt daughter in the future? :3. “Why are you so calm?”\n\n“Because I\'m main character ” feels like you\'d kind of want to draft the veterans. Wow So Excited For Movie The TOMORROW War We all know the twist is his daughter is gonna show up in the future and be mean to him because he left 30 years ago to fight, right? It has to happen. Hear that? That was the sound of my truck driving through big enough plot holes. Edge of Tomorrow--> meets Time Cop-->meets World War Z--> meets Tenet-->meets Independence Day.  I like it! Bruce Banner just face palmed at the time travel element when they drop through the portal, its almost like a battle royale game concept I am ready for Chris Pratt to play Jack Reese Have a feeling that Emily Blunt or Tom Cruise will be cameo in this movie.\n\nPatt: Wait. We met each other?\nCruise: Well. Might not be the last. Who the hell are they fighting? I didn’t see an enemy. ooo super bir filim  sebirsizlikle gözleyirem.From Azerbaijan 🇦🇿 Looks like it\'s something from the Cloverfield universe/timeline Sad it isn\'t ""The Forever War"" by Joe Haldeman. Someone needs to turn the book or graphic novels by Marvano into a movie asap!   Please, someone, PLEASE!! What\'s scary in changing the past. Unlike back to the future. When you go back to your present, you will realize you are no longer part of it because there is another you who resides in that new timeline. I\'m sick of sci-fi movie protagonists fighting the good fight...for the children! Seriously, do we need to know the protagonist has a cute kid to root for them? So at what point in the movie is Arnold gonna ""be back"" again? And again one guy saving the world... and again he is the only hope for the humanity This is a good movie for this year Calling it right now, he probably meets his daughter in the future. That\'s usually how these movies go wait, if they can remove people from the past and not affect the events that lead to the future that they come from, why doesnt all the future people just stay in the past and prepare the Earth for the impending invasion? is it not easier to prep for the invasion rather than fight a losing battle by throwing bodies at it? Take everyone to the past and live peacefully So let me get this straight, they sent present beings to the future to change things?\n\nThe lack of logic in some of these movies.... I think I\'ll watch this sometime in the future, on a very boring Sunday afternoon, if it\'s on TV and I\'m feeling particularly lazy and have nothing else to do. \nEven then, not sure I\'ll get through it. Might switch the channel, or just fall asleep. Take humans from the past to fight a war in the future... makes sense Ah so this is one of the timelines Loki has to fix Id go the equlity route and had my wife go in my place cause she is stunning and brave! ""hey look it\'s the daughter from the future!"" : everyone while watching the movie From China\'s Skydance, featuring time traveling soldiers from the future fighting machines with tentacles. Definitely not recycled Terminator Dark Fate material I mean when you think about it we are all living on borrowed time. Life itself is a privilege, the greatest gift ever given and yet we waste it killing each other and wining over imaginary hardships im so confused. just because they go and win a war in the future does not mean that that future war will not happen for those in the present. They should have drafted Liberty Bell because she had mad killing skills in The Hunt. If they are from the future why cant they.......................\n\nNope. It\'s a time travel movie with Chris Pratt in it. I\'m going to watch it anyway.. “Why are you so calm?”\n“Because plot armor duh” Well they basically just showed the entire movie in the trailer, so I guess now I don\'t actually have to go see it️ I clicked so fast I thought this was ""The Forever War"" then realised my mistake. What a shame becuase the Joe Haldeman book was one of my faves. Still this looks OK I guess, combining elements of several other movies from the last 5 years though. I hope there\'s something new in it. I just want to save my daughter, if I have to save the\'WORLD\' to do that, I will. I mean the ONE thing guaranteed to make an alien apocalypse worse is to throw in the mother of all temporal paradoxes. So you can go back in time but you can’t prepare for an attack with 30 years prep? The most unbelievable part of this trailer is that people asked for help and we are just like, ""gotchu fam, one draft coming up"" IF…YOU…HAVE..THE..TECHNOLOGICAL! (MBAKU) ADVANTAGE…TO…TIME TRAVEL…THERE SHOULD BE NO WAR! (nuff said) this movie seems more comedic than drama. This trailer reminds me of Ben Stiller’s The Watch. for anyone whos confused on y they dropping people without chutes ,its to get a kill by dropping them on aliens head What happens when the run out of present day soldiers?\n\nDo they recruit WW2 soldiers? I\'m just curious to know how can people 10 years in the future order people in the past to do something. Just spraying them pastels and kill them in that person won\'t be in the future to give you orders..\nThis is almost similar to that Tom Cruise movie. Nada como estar en Marvel Chris Pratt: “I will be back!”\nChris Pratt’s father in law: Laughs The premise makes as much sense as sending World War One biplanes up against the Luftwaffe of World War Two. There\'s no way in Hell they\'ll be able to - oh, wait; they have Chris Pratt with them? Okay, we\'re safe. Brought to you by the writer of Alien, the director of Terminator, and the mind of the guyirl who made Edge of Tomorrow. I know this movie doesn\'t make any logical sense (as of now), but there\'s probably a reason as to why this is the ""plot"". We\'ll still see how this turns out lol. I can\'t imagine someone deliberately making this the plot, either there\'s more to it or they\'re drunk while writing the movie, and I\'d like to believe the former. Ooooo.... this looks good ! great movie i watched the entire thing but who cares about soccer when there is  fast action to view 0:34   Chris Pratt: "" I Will be Back "" \n\nArnie:  "" Take that James Cameron! Now I can die in pieces! "" I forgot how handsome Chris Pratt is Did anyone catch the ""I\'ll be back"" line which is clearly a nod to his father-in-law, Arnold?! So Chris Pratt. That\'s all I need. So. . . It\'s like reverse Terminator. Travel to the future to kill the threat. We can\'t say ""I\'ll be back!"" Only, ""I\'ll be then!"" Why didn\'t they time the drops so the soldiers from the past landed on top of the aliens, so that 70% of the alien invasion force was killed too? I think there reason why Future humanity lost to alien invasion is because most top tier from to the past who are supposed to be a threat to them are gone because they went to the future to fight. Everyones on the time travel and timeline thing, but set that aside, wouldnt humans in the future fight wars with the drones, machines and AI instead? Is this going to be like most other Prime films where the trailer turns out to be way better than the actual film? You know it’s a good one when Chris takes off his shirt... The Acting is good the premise fails on so many different time paradoxes. Me: Mom, can we have TENET?\nMom: No, we have TENET at home.\nTENET at home: Just like all the ex-military American vets I know, sitting around in a Leave it to Beaver sweater watching the World Cup. Now this movie makes me think we might have alien  spaceship hiding somewhere  The idea is cool, I like the casting, great actors...but the writing seems very late 90s. It is just a trailer, I\'ll give a go. Looks like it\'s going to be a disappointment.. the book was AMAZING Why wouldn’t they just say “hey past tense people. Here’s exactly the threat we’re up against. Here’s our current tech. You’ve got 30 years to figure it out.” What I like about these trailers is they let you know how crap the film is. Good job. despite the trailer, i\'ll probably still watch this ish I am not a physician but won\'t it mean that if people from our time die, next generation won\'t be born and it will change the entire future or at least create alternative future. I\'m referring to back to the future movie and if I\'m wrong I\'ll be happy to hear your explanations, this movie creates lots of questions. The aliens probably wiped most of humanity out in some sort of pre-emptive strike, so the premise could work I\'m getting Edge Of Tomorrow vibes ""Why are you so calm?""\n""Oh come on I\'m Starlord man!"" This film looks dope!\nBtw are those zergs ? The Critical Drinker will love this one!  Honestly Chriss Pratt + Time travel/ WAR movies, IM FUCKIN DOWN! after this event everybody will be like reverse flash except no powers but in a giant paradox. When does it come out though??? That “pitch meeting” guy is gonna shred this one.\nEDIT. @ryangeorge released the pitch meeting video Congrats everyone, for the next 5 years all movies and shows will deal with either time travel or alternate universes. It looks fun but why not just send the technology and knowledge of future events back to the past so we could just prevent the whole issue from happening in the first place? Just a thought....... Expect a war in real life... Chris Pratt would\'ve made a perfect Nathan Drake heres a major plot hole point... if they are fighting a war in the future, why not bring their future tech back 30 years so that 30 years later they\'re further advanced than they were before? One would think with the many Terminator movies out there, they’d explore such a nice concept. I’m watching this. I love it already. I know I\'m going to be disappointed by the ending. Humanity probably survives. Hmmm. Looks promising. Like the concept. Let’s see if they can deliver. \nOr this the prequel to Edge of Tomorrow? If they are going to kill the queen to stop the war, I am going to be really pissed. If its only a single timeline just loop back until you win the war in the past, if its a branch timeline why people from the past help people from the future? even if they won it wont change the future of people in the past. 8/10 must watch movie I understand this is fun entertainment, but it’s almost guaranteed at this point that ET’s are not our enemies, yet we’ve been and continue to be trained through all available channels to think otherwise. Likewise, we’ve been trained to think we’d even stand a chance. If they wanted us gone, we’d be destroyed in literally half a second. Why do they go fight in the future? And not just go back in the past and prepare for the war? Well they showed us the whole film and I\'m sure we can guess the ending. Basically it\'s like Terminator, but we don\'t send one Terminator and Human into the past, but we send military from past to future where they don\'t gonna fight with Terminators, but with Aliens  The ""Why not just bring tech to the past and spend the time preparing so you just win?"" plot hole is a pretty big hole to fill. I don\'t think 2021 Hollywood is up to the job. Sorry Starlord. At least some movies like Terminator got it right.... 30 years ago. Should\'ve draft more Chris Pratt as one army because protagonists can\'t die and doesn\'t run out its ammo So Edge of Tomorrow but we get no do-overs and even less enemy screentime? 0:25 “Is this a joke?” My sentiments exactly. Looks good! What’s funny is that we think aliens that look like that will wipe us out completely and yet we’re losing most of our population by a single mutated virus  They sure do say ""from the face of the earth"" a lot for dramatic effect. Isn\'t it better to get people of the future to the past to prepare? Like if people from the past go and die, weren\'t it just make it worse when the aliens come?! So 0:22\n""We are fighting a war 30 years in the future""\n\nand then they say  if they drafted people from the past and those people died in the future, doesn\'t it mean the human population in the past shrunk? Why not draft soldiers from parallel universe? We are getting it wrong. Time travel is one thing that everyone can play with. And since it\'s a movie, the chances of giving another perspective to it is not uncommon. \n\nI mean it would be obvious for many that the future should go back to the past, as in the current present. Prepare them for an upcoming war. Like Terminator and so many others. But when we think about it, we don\'t know how it really works. I have a feeling this would be the perfectbattle royal. You\'re in the future, dropping from the sky, barely any gear, wrecked and abandonded city... I had no earthly idea any human\'s mind could cook up something this ludicrous. Maybe this is more of a cyborg movie then? No humans were involved in the making of it? Yup looks great! When is the war? Tomorrow.\nWhen do we want it? ....Today? \'""We can send you back and forth through time, yeah the future is that cool. Also, can you flap your arms really hard and fast? We don\'t have a helmet budget and for some odd reason, we drop about three quarters of you past soldiers from like eighty feet up. You\'ll probably still die but we\'ll get a kick and you flapping your flesh wings as you splat on the ground. LET""S GO SAVE TOMORROW!"" (I\'m still totally gonna watch it) They should bring Genghis Khan and general Patton to the Future War Let me guess he ends up working with his daughter from the future and realizes he never went back. Fights to stop the war and go back and change the future. This movie plot is like when the dumb kid at the party says hold my beer. You know he\'s gonna do something stupid, but now you have to watch it just to see how bad it\'s actually going to be. I really don\'t get all the bad reviews. The movie was extremely entertaining. What do you really expect from an Alien Invasion Movie? Time travel always goes to shit, everytime, because ""science-fiction"", is really both words and there\'s no way you can even try to disguise time travel as science :-) Better use these 30 years to hire just one scenarist with a brain who can come up with a better story :-) chris pratt is on the team...we can\'t lose Couldn’t they have gone like 1 year back or a couple years back instead of going back 30 years to make people who are not advanced in technology or shit to fight. Im still holding out hope this is a secret comedy and not the straight forward action shooter these trailers make it out to be. Well, I\'m actually already doing my part now by eating Calamari and Octopus. Soldier from future: Why r u so calm?\nChris: Dude... I\'ve fought Thanos and his army! I wonder if Chris Pratt will ever make an edgy movie or is he always going to be just Andy Dwyer. Best is just how little the enemy is shown. That has to be the worst time travel movie plot I\'ve ever heard, ever. The fight for tomorrow, begins the day after tomorrow. I like when Amazon smiles at me! we need to put a bracelet on you, but for the benefit of the""story"" please Chris show your abs   I love all these movies that imply aliens or machines will wipe humans from the face of the Earth when we all know it\'s going to be Mother Earth herself that consumes us. Whats wrong with drafting betty gilpin? After ""the hunt"" i have more trust on her than pratt. Yep...definitely seeing it Skynet: ""This is ridiculously stupid use of time travel....""\nProducers: ""Maybe we could brainwash some kids to talk their parents into Amazon Prime subscription.""\nJeff B: ""This movie is actually cheaper than my yacht crew salary..."" Maybe  Chris Pratt is the future Batman Haha  Let me guess the woman he was talking to when he travels forward in time is his daughter. \n\nI\'ll watch it when I\'m asleep. You have a time machine, go back thousands of years and kick start the technical revolution way way earlier. I like how they now basically show the entire movie just to desperately get you to watch instead of going back in time to prevent this disaster we are going to go forward in time to fight it with borrowed time?  WHAT DA FUCK? I can hardly wait for the Pitch Meeting on this lol That movie is so good i like that movie ""So We\'re Saving the Galaxy Again?""\n""I AM GROOT!"" the plot look nice. can\'t wait to watch this. ""We will not go quietly into the night, we will not vanish without a fight, we will.... wait, who set the release date on July 2nd?"" Looks pretty cool to bad I wont pay to watch it If the fight is in the future then why wouldn\'t you bring the army to right before the invasion to stop it? Go to the future to avoid war ? That is not a good idea ! well as long as he dont mess up like he did before, well he did made endgame happened. This face of the earth thing is too medieval now Star-Lord looks up a staircase, sees an alien and thinks \'Yeah, Blue would fuck that shit up\' An revese-terminator storyline? Are the future soldiers not suppose to be able to send back tech and info to the past to prepare them for the coming WAR? Wouldn\'t it be smarter to go back in time an prepare the humans better, or warn them about the war coming up. Or starting like a breeding program to maximize the amount of available fighters they would have in the future. There are so many better ideas Guess I figured out where was Star-Lord  during Marvel\'s Blip. He traveled to the future. wow, I really hope they have a really good explanation for the ""we need to take soldiers into the future, instead of all the other possible solutions"" part... otherwise this will be one of the dumbest time travel movies ever made. He did\'nt dare to say the iconic sentence of his father in law. Only in its whole form (0:34.) :) it doesn\'t look awful, i guess with the current state of movies that says something The problem about this time travel movies is they don’t seem to understand butterfly effect. You cant bring a “past” person to the future because it will be definitely different. For example, think adam and eve as a real story, Imagine taking adam or eve from the past to the present it will immediately change the timeline. WoW! That Script, Pay homage to the writer ""Can you detect sarcasm?"" Shhh!!\nThen proceeds to point gun at enemy in dark stair well with torch still on Curious about this but the main thought I have is that why don’t they just terminator that Shiz and kill the source in the past? Hopefully that gets brought up cause if not it just seems like a plot hole Battle For LA meets Independence Day meets Terminator. What could go wrong? Every alien/monster in films and tv shows is some faceless slimy creature that makes that exact same sound when they’re around humans They would automatically create an alternate timeline by jumping backwards. Why not just tell the governments when they come. How to fight it. By going backwards they created a different outcome Pratt chooses to do this over wrapping up Guardians of the Galaxy 3? Oh well, everyones got bills to pay, I guess. Gilpin and Pratt...in the same movie...#blessed Matt Damon likes to be rescued.\nChris Pratt likes to save the planet and universe.\n\nThe paradox people, time travel would most likely split the into an alternate timeline, so no matter what happened to the past they went to, it won\'t affect their own past, only the future of the timeline they interfered with and their own future by bringing new people into it. Ideally they would train the current populace and recruit at the same time. Be careful who you root for. I smell a heaven / hell of a twist. God: So how\'d you get here?\nMe: Was drafted to fight a war but there wasn\'t a conviniently place pool to cushion my 1000 foot fall.\nGod: That\'s been happening a lot The most American looking movie I\'ve seen so far for 2021.\n\nLooks cool but that\'s about all we\'ll get from it. I see Chris Pratt and I automatically like it. Surely, if your send if you send your ancestors to fight in the future it risks wiping out their descendants? How have they not watched Doctor Who and the theory of the ""timey wimey"" thing? ok so... time travel why not just pull your troops in from before they died? if you pull people from 30 years in the past would that not be killing solders in the future who wont be born because of dead parents? Huge problem with this whole movie, if you can travel back in time why not prepare in the past instead of traveling to an apocalyptic future, didn’t they watch Terminator?!?! In the end Chris Pratt and the rest of the survivors goes back in time again(this time he will lead) recruit people to fight in another Tomorrow War. He better recruit Annie, y\'know that curly-haired orphan um, never mind. I hope it’s not one of those movies where when you kill the head alien, all others run away. Cause that already happened in edge of tomorrow and Battle LA Starlord forgot his father in law is the Terminator. Things could\'ve been easy we need the flash to explain again the timeline continuum I don\'t understand why he doesn\'t get Groot, Rocket, Drax and Gamora to come with him. That fight would be over in 15 minutes. Seems Badass Вместо того что бы подготовить людей прошлого(родителей своих) к будущей войне, вы берёте их в будущее? Что?\nИ самое худшее то, что в трейлере показали всё. Мы видели завязку и почти всю кульминацию, развязку додумать уже будет не сложно. Audience: Man, this movie sucks!\n\nWriter/Director: Any ideas how to make it better? Where is Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt with their Mech Suits when you need’em This trailer could have been 1 minute long and would have been enough. Looks like it could be good though. Why not send them to the point where it starts?\nThey literally have a time machine. Oh, human madness is about to end? Finally, let them in =) the destiny 2 movie we\'ve all been waiting for Id be like ""30 years"" huh, time to party and I promise not to have anymore kids this was dope when it was the one with tom cruise and the evil squids tho This will be my birthday present from Cris Pratt.\nThnx for that release date. Personally, I\'m rooting for the aliens... If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future, and your former present becomes the past, which can\'t now be changed by your new future.  I guess starlord was dead at the time Hulk explained it. If such a thing were to happen, people of now will refer to those soldiers of the future as conspiracy theorists. How is bringing people to the future stopping something that is happening IN the future? If you can go to the present/past, START there!! Ah, a battle to safe human species from being extinct on planet earth.\n\nImperial Guard: Hmm? First time?\nCadian; The planet broke before we did Me, out loud to myself: ""Wow, this looks dumb"" He can save the future by the dance.....like he did In GOG and here I was thinking that they would go back and say something like ""start preparing for this thing that is about to happen in 30 years since we discovered time travel and would like to get a head start"" If you think about it, their logic actually makes sense. If the ""Past""s present is the  ""Present""s past, then The ""Present"" is the ""Past""\'s Future. You can\'t go back to the ""past"" because it will create paradoxes in the timeline. But you can certainly go to your Future. See? You know.... this future world reminds me of Zack Snyders JL world - apocalypse. This looked ok like battle Los Angeles. I keep seeing Christopher Pratt as a Comedy actor. i have really only seen him in Guardian of the galaxy films only, but i thought his comedy in final Avengers film was bit to much. Good to see being serious and taking alien killing serious lol. I put the time travel paradox aside,\nYou can time travel meaning tech is advance enough to develop better weapon and they still fighting with bullet? They have time travel capabilities and they use it to draft soldiers from the past? Why not just use it to stop the invasion from happening in the first place? Chris pratt: ""I\'ll be back.""\n\nArnold: Take katherine\'s hand son. Producer: So is there a complicated plot to explain time travel, both backwards and forward and how that would effect who would be and not be born in that future? \n\nWriter: Nope, barley and inconvenience actually. \n\nProducer: Oh, ok then... does it explain why the future people don\'t just go back to like Rome or something and jump start mankind\'s evolution so they can be ready for the alien attack in 6,000 years? If they have a time machine, they would probably manage to invent something better than ar-15 to fight aliens. Hollywood is probably soon going to be recruiting writers from the past to save the future of movies. Replace aliens with global warming and this is actually a true story. Plot twist: The female commander  is actually his daughter. have to give a thumbs up for Hollywood to come out with the weirdest story lines ever * takes bong hit *\n""dude... what if like... future people came back... and like made us go with them?""\n* opens bloodshot eyes * \n""whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?"" Plot twist : the aliens they\'re facing are actually evolved humans from an even further distant future. How to give the grandfather paradox a dramatic twist. so you fight future wars with soldiers that shoot bullets instead of robots or drones?  So the future soldier go to the present to hire the people to go back to the past and prevent the war that might cause the end of the world in the futurr...nice. Thank you for the plot trailer. great movie, this is ""ALIENS MEET PREDATORS"" non-stop action So..... people walk out of a wormhole and you\'re just gonna be like ""You need fresh meat from the past to fight a war? Okay that checks out lets go, you\'re the boss"" And they’re still using the old humvees. I get that they’re reliable, but since it’s the future, they would’ve created something more modern with way better armor since they are going against aliens if they possibly draft only those from the past that have no future, since their children and childrens children are already dead, than at least there wont be much of a paradoxon when it comes to losing ancestors to people in the future. they had no future anyway so vanishing aint an issue i guess. How can a war happening in the future save the past? ... I think the whole concept of the movie is flawed from the start... If they can travel through time and space but the only idea they come up with is compulsory  drafting then extinction is well deserved Great action, great CGI. Abysmal movie though. Strongly Dislike Amazon’s Politics so I Won’t watch this but, looks better then anything coming out of Hollywood in Years.  Chris Pratt is a good man. Serves our Lord Jesus Is it wrong that I have my fingers crossed for the other guys? Thank god they drafted Rex Dangervest. Movie: 70% of draftee\'s don\'t return.\n\nMe: Yeah, they literally fall from the sky and fall to their death. If the future is more automated,shouldn\'t they be drafting gamers from the present rather than soldiers? Who doesn\'t have Amazon Prime already? That\'s what I want to know Why pull people from the past to fight a war of the future when you could just prepare for 30 years... This could be one those Wolf in Sheep clothing, type of movies. As in the aliens come as us to make us fight the war for them, with just lies and tales of events to happen... When we don\'t know our fate, but find it out mid way doing it...

Cinderella,"['T1NeHRuPpoM', '20DF6U1HcGQ', 'LfR8Su4ulX0', 'VDB3onzBMfI', '-Ra6hmW9Iew']","['Cinderella the only thing i learned from this trailer is that i should go back and watch the masterpiece that was lily james and richard madden’s chemistry in cinderella (2015) this movie is everything no one asked for In a perfect world, the only Cinderella movie we got was the classic Disney one. The more I look at this the more I think Thanos wasn\'t the bad guy afterall The only good thing about this is that they managed to condense the whole movie into three minutes. Which means we don\'t have waste time on the full feature. The movie was so good that my mom got out of the casket and turned the television off. So good :) I like how the twist here seems to be that everyone, including the stepmother, actually wants Cinderella to marry the Prince but that it\'s Cinderella herself who doesn\'t want it. I\'m starting to think Cinderella is the real \'tale as old as time\' with them remaking it every 5 years Without the singing and dancing, this is pretty much the whole movie ""Cinderella"": The story of a woman in a modern, fully integrated society who wants to commit herself to a life menial work over potentially taking on a leadership role. Next up: ""The Rosa Parks Story"", about a woman in a society free of all racial discrimination who aspires to becoming a bus driver despite parental pressure to accept a unversity scholarship. “Would you be my princesses”\n “what about my work” \nthat’s just the saddest fairytale ever So basically, this film exists to ruin everyone\'s childhood.  “Cinderella never asked for a prince, she asked for a night off and a dress” ""I pick you to be my Princess.""\n""But, what about my work!""\n\nAnd from that day forth, Cinderella worked 80 hour weeks, for minimum wage in the basement of a Paris Fashion House, ""living her dream"" and churning out dresses for the Princes new Princess. It’s sad that I’m learning about this now and wished I had the 3 minutes of my life back This is a movie we didn’t ask for- the only Cinderella’s that should exist is the original 1950 version and the 2015 live action the godmother is a magical, powerful woman who\'s able to sympathize with cinderella and help her make her dreams come true... you have a woman giving strength to another. \nchanging it to a man falls into the stupid \'gay best friend\' trope and erases the significance of the fairy godmother being a woman altogether. This is so forced, why call it Cinderella when this a whole new character with a different personality and way of thinking. You the base of the original Cinderella and formed it into something that doesn’t even relate to the original story anymore, changed the characters, why would you remove and replace key characters in the story, and the message is so forced out. “Be yourself” or “you don’t need a man”. I get it, the message isn’t a bad one but it’s so forced, doesn’t feel right at all, implying so much feminist ideals into a story that kids would read or watch, might as well make this a new princess and not related to Cinderella at all. The only thing missing from this trailer are the end credits Maybe instead of making a movie from a well-known story with several changes, they should change the whole story like what Shrek did with various well-known fairytales. This trailer itself is a movie\nIt has covered almost everything Nothing can beat the original and the 2015 Cinderella. 2015 Cinderella chemistry and cast was perfect I thought I was the only one feeling odd about this whole thing. It’s a weird departure from my fairytale It\'s a huge high profile movie everyone\'s talking about, but no-one\'s watching This trailer tells everything about this whole movies  I\'m glad we got the animations, the OG Cinderella during our times and made us feel happy from the fairytales and romances on our childhood. Idina in Frozen: you cant marry someone you just met\nIdina in Cinderella: Marry him and all our problem will be solved. I hope no little kids will grow up watching this version. Parents protect your children When the fairy godmother came in I actually laughed out loud Honestly, it was one of the best movies that I\'had watched during my entire life(Camila cabello excelled in her role, along with the wonderful songs that she performed with her amazing voice) This movie contains a deep message, which is that we must pursue our dreams to achieve them, no matter what difficulties we face, and the most important thing is that we should believe in ourselves, even if anyone did not, in addition we must choose ourselves and therefore others will choose us. This is what happens when you focus more on your movie being diverse than good writing. James corden is in every shitty musical, he needs a new agent yesterday This seems more like an Snl skit than an actual movie. To me, this really isn\'t Cinderella anymore when the story is so changed. They could have named it something else and said ""inspired by the Cinderella story."" What we all really needed was another Cinderella movie. I love how everyone’s avoiding it  I’m crying  and it’s not because the trailer was good but because this is how movies are going to look like from now. Remember when female empowerment actually felt good in a Cinderella movie like in Ever After featuring Drew Barrymore or even Ella Enchanted? Okay I wasn\'t very sure about this movie but the twist they are giving it interest me. Plus, any musical with ""Somebody to love"" as soundtrack is a YES for me!\n\nEDIT: Never thought I would get this many likes but thank you everyone! Been watching Camila since day 1 on X factor. Happy to see her keep growing. At this point, it looks like rich people  are doing parodies of movies just because they can. Just watched it today and its such a fun movie! Perfect maybe not but it\'s nicely done and I had a good time, especially since I just love Cinderella. There could never be enough Cinderella movies for me Well, still can\'t beat the original Cinderella cartoon  When I promote Disney to bring all the bonus Cinderella stories to life, they will extend the entire story of the animated Cinderella. ""I am your fabulous godfat... mother""\n\ndies from cringe Sometimes we really have to let Disney protect these stories… Will we ever get a musical film trailer without going ""Why the hell is James Cordon in this one too?""\n\nY\'all got a lot of opinions about him. Good for you. The moment you see James corden is in it you automatically know its going to be a fucking catastrophe  ""YES!...I will trade a life of pampering and riches to toil away scrubbing and cleaning if I don\'t get my way!!!"" Said no woman ever of that era I need a Cinderella like this. I mean, there are thousands of versions of Cinderella from all different regions and we all know that they do exist. But I am still willing to hear another story of Cinderella retold by someone else, someone new like this. Idk I feel like it\'s possible to have your dream career and get married to the love of your life simultaneously... I miss the old days with simple romantic movies tbh this is the one musical we did not need. How many Cinderella movies does this make now, I\'ve lost count. Thank God someone was woke enough to wake up and know that it would have been butchered at the box office and took the OTT route. It is no less than a murder of a classic! In the 2007 movie ""Enchanted"", Idina Menzel plays Nancy Tremaine whose last name is like Cinderella\'s step mother\'s from the 1950 Disney movie. In this movie, she portrays the stepmother. My favorite Cinderella film was on 2015 , acted by lily James and Richard madden it was better than this and it was a wonderful masterpiece! Es una película interesante y un musical encantador.  No hay mucho más  y no me parece que sea ""LA"" película del año y tampoco que esté  tan mal. En líneas generales es bastante entretenida. i thought i\'d never see the day where Cinderella is the worst character in HER OWN story LOOOOOOOOL Holy cow, the stepmom here is actually thinking about the advantages of a stepdaughter marrying into royalty. Nothing will beat Ever After with drew Barrymore that was the best Cinderella ever! ""What about my work?"" is the most realistic line ""Even magic has its limits"" basically nothing can make a heel comfortable  I can see Queen Elsa as a fashion designer. But this is the first time that we\'re seeing Cinderella as a fashion designer. I bet Elsa and Cinderella spend their time working on fashion together. “If singing doesn’t work out for you, then try acting” - the art of war Just watched the movie. It was really fun And it was worth it. I’ve learned something about this movie. And kudos to camilla she really did an amazing job! Beautiful  Wow, so much hate. It is a movie people. Lighten up. It is a refreshing remake of an old classic with modern music, contemporary talent, and an interesting twist to the original story. I loved it. If you haven\'t seen it yet ignore all of the negativity flowing through these comments and give it a chance. You may find it enjoyable, even fun to watch! Elsa: “Marry him and all our problems will be solved.”\nElla: “You can’t marry a man you just met.” The modern music was awesome in this classic fairy tale! Loved it!  This makes me appreciate the Disney remake more I watched it with a lot of expectations after watching the trailer but this movie like no other made me watch just 10min and then I could see myself fast forwarding for the next 20min and finally switched off my Television with total irritation... \nThe best part of fairytale remakes would be the songs in them but here when someone opens their mouth to sing, your stomach starts to churn out of irritation  “But you just did a whole thing”.  Amazing writing; hard to believe that the last line of dialogue was supposed to serve as comic relief.  \nAlso, is it not extremely illogical that they would even pick a Disney princess story as the backdrop for some contrived feminist message? Love this oh nick and Camila are perfect and they can sing!! wow, she’s really good at singing. she should pursue a career in music. James Corden being in it is Just adding to the failure. How many more times do we have to watch a remake of this story? It feels like there are already 20 movie versions of Cinderella out there. I loved this take on the age old story. Refreshing point of view, songs and dances are just perfect and different than previous versions. Nicholas Galitzine physical beauty is a strong selling point plus his acting skills are matching for this role, he steals the scenes he is in  - A perfect casting decision in my opinion. Over all I loved this movie ( considering I had no good expectations before tuning in ). A respectful mention to magical Idina Menzel - one can\'t take eyes away from her expressions and singing. The costumes are magnificent and surreal as they are supposed to for fairy tale. Best thing about this movie is James Acaster being in it, what a legend! This is as much of Cinderella as I’m going to watch, but Billy Porter is everything.  As much as I love the Cinderella story, Hollywood has overused it way too much It would have been so much more meaningful if Shawn Mendes took the role of the prince I like this version of Cinderella, it’s so funny when she said “you can’t marry a man U just met” I\'m gonna be honest the only character I like in this movie is the fairyless godmother  I\'m really amazed by Talluah greive\'s beauty.️️ (prince\'s sister in this movie). Love her so much and hope to see her more in other movies. This movie would have only been 30 minutes if it weren\'t for the singing why did they make another cinderella remake when the lily james one is flawless At this point, we might need a Cinderella roll call. We\'ve had so many that they\'re enough to become a nation. This fits perfectly with a song she wrote entitled Cinderella\n\n""Cinderella never asked for a prince no,\nJust a dress, there anybody like this oh? The casting for the mice is elite.\n\nI would watch for James Acaster alone. Only the best part of movie was of Idina Menzel.. Her voice and singing ️ this is the first time watching the trailer, a few weeks ago my sister mentioned this cinderella movie and Camilla Cabello was the cinderella, and I was like ""whaaat?"" Camilla is amazing btw, but I just can\'t imagine her being cinderella. Even magic has its limits. Even he couldn’t make glass heels comfortable and he has magic So nice of them to include James Corden in the trailer to warn everyone not to watch the movie. I feel like not enough people know that Disney doesn’t actually own Cinderella (or any of the princesses, except Elsa and Anna) so literally anybody can make a Cinderella movie, a Little Mermaid movie, a Snow White movie if they wanted to. And they could make it however they want exactly how Disney did. (If you know the real Cinderella story, you’re a well cultured legend) My non-woke but still progressive ending. The Prince learned to stand up to the king and defend his love for Ella, and he started to become a mature and responsible man and a wise king. He assigned his sister to be his Main Adviser/Minister, and their kingdom prospered. Ella became the Queen and in her free time, she still keeps designing and making clothes. She secretly gives her designs to her Stepmother, and she taught her step-sisters on how to sew/make dresses. Her Stepmother opened up a shop with Ella\'s design, while Ella\'s step-sisters make them, and sometimes Ella joins them. They become rich from the dress business, so now that they don\'t need to find wealthy husbands, the stepmother let one of Ella\'s step-sister to marry the poor hunky stable guy. And they live happily ever after, THE END. I\'m so proud of Camila from a shy girl who only sang karaoke and watched One Direction videos auditioning on Xfactor to selling millions and now starring in a movie. This was such a good movie (I watched it before watching this) 9/10!!! Close but I’m still shook that they can’t capture the funk that Brandy and Whitney’s Cinderella has forever imprinted—ima still watch this looool I would\'ve wanted the dress I made restored instead of that new one lol it looked way better and it was the product of her own work and she was so proud of it This trailer got me really excited for this new take on Cinderella. And Camila looks like a natural in this role. Great cast, fresh storyline and amazing soundtrack. I\'m in! Idina Menzel is an amazing actress. She’s so talented with a beautiful outstanding voice. She was the best thing about this movie, she did a good job (as much as I like Camila Cabello, this movie needed Idina Menzel because the movie is just meh, then again it is literally meant for kids anyway) Also Idina was in an even better movie kind of similar to Cinderella, Enchanted with Amy Adams, she was in that too. And I think she voices Elsa in Frozen right? Idina’s acting is amazing and I love her voice so much They should\'ve just created a new story at this point. Loved every single bit of this movie. :) Seriously, lenses to give this movie more credit! It was my favorite Cinderella movie and to be honest, it was a lot more inspirational that the 2015 Cinderella movie. Can we get the “early life” on the producers please. Can we stop concluding just from the trailor and dig deep into the story. It\'s honestly way more embarrassing that James Corden was in this. I felt the intensity in her words ""I have dreams to chase"". No Cinderella had ever said that to the prince.\nEdit : I believe that we all deserve to put forth our opinions, and I am not at all embarrassed to admit that my support stretches out afar to the essence of feminism. However, in this comment of mine, I have nowhere claimed the \'f\' of feminism. If anyone still thinks that it does talk about it, then be it that way. I don\'t think being a feminist is anywhere a wrong approach. Moreover, having a family and living happily is undeniably a sweet dream. What I appreciate about Camila Cabello\'s words is that she dares to have other dreams too. Did I write anything appertaining to my elation over the possibility that she may not choose to be with the prince? Why are some people ransacking such meanings out of my comment which are absolutely incorrect? I am only happy about the fact that she ventures to nurture dreams of her own. Do you guys want to see a Cinderella who sits like a doll all day in the palace of a prince? What\'s wrong if she prefers to work after marriage? Does it keep her from marrying the prince? I don\'t think so, given the prince really loves her. Kindly halt this hassle in the comments\' section over a concept that I DID NOT BRING UP AT THE FIRST PLACE. I actually liked it a lot :) something different from a princess only wanting marriage . She actually wants a career and a future not just a husband This movie is a paradise of music & love After watching the Lily James trailer this feels like a Dhar Mann remake I love the movie I literally watch it everyday I have already watched it 20 times they all did a great job  this is ssssssooo giving me Ella enchanted vibes mixed with Brandys cinderella movie both movies are awesome with lil intoo the wood vibes as well as the if the shoes fit aka cinderella movies starring sofia carson vibes an tots loving the shade they be throwing with the whole ""there made of glass ""bit . but loving the whole bit they add after word with \n\'but can you make them more comfortable ?"" an the godmother dude giving tots whitney houston vibes with that sass says evenmagic has it limits lolololololololol  love this cant wait too see this lol an that sound the shoes make tots make them sound like glass nice touch there. I always known Camila was gonna do big things ever since I’ve been a fan of her back in 2013 I’m proud she’s starting to act :) This movie is absolutely gonna be loved by many young girls around the world. I love the message behind it but i personally felt like it was kinda cringy , maybe, it\'s because I\'m a little old. But yea, okayish movie! I\'d still give it a 3/5. Masterpieces are always born once... So she has her own dreams to do her own thing and doesn\'t what to be stuck in a Palace? Why did you go to the ball then, that was the whole point, the Prince was picking out someone he liked, so weird. Believe or not, I\'ve always imagined Billy Porter playing the fairy God mother for Cinderella  i guess I found the best version of cinderella its thisss. The characters reallly suit their  roles,camilla was d bessttttt. and yes, the musical songs are d best that i cant get offfff wid lotsa luv frm sri lanka “Yeah I was just crying and singing about it like two minutes ago” LMAO I just finished watching the movie and i really liked it a lot. Cinderella just always hits home for me personally haha and I have to say even though I found it a little cringy at first I still appreciated the vocals a lot. The general storyline is also really wholesome and omg Billy Porter elevated the movie ""her name is Ella so get it right"". Scrolling through the comments I only see hate but people don’t even want to give this movie a fair shot in my opinion.. and like Cinderella is for fucking kids so to all the people saying it’s a teeny movie, no it’s not. I loved Cinderella growing up but the general message is sexist and fucked up. If I had kids I would prefer showing them this movie (I would show both lol) and even though they portrayed sexism well I wished they would have tackled the topic further because it kinda felt half assed at the end. This is so beautiful I’m so excited about this movie! Parabéns pra quem fez essa versão amei  a madrasta tá menos má as irmãs tbm mas continuo com ranso das três! Movie was so amazing i watched it todayy and i just lovrd this version of cindrella also The story will always remain the same no matter what Tbh if they didn\'t tried to just trademark this as a Cinderella movie then it could have been an ok decent-ish musical comedy. They could have even called it a tribute. This feels like it was made by a bunch of middle-aged people desperately trying to make a movie that they thought might appeal to teenagers. Just... no. Why can’t she marry him AND be a high fashion  creator? Actual Royals (not the ones running countries but members of the court) did that pretty frequently and loads of other creative endeavours because they had the resources to do so. The fact that Camila is In this movie i already love  Cinderella I’m really gonna love ️ it now you go Queen Camila I watched it like right after the “cats” so yeah i enjoyed cinderella  Me muero por verla ya pero me encantaria en español amoo Camila Cabello tiene una voz hermosa y su actitud es una buena perona  It should be on Netflix too !!! They didn’t ruin Cinderella because this is not Cinderella lmao With lots of things i wasn\'t able to absorb (music) the was fab... its the identity and not just the life partner you wish to live for... A great theme indeed! Lovely, my family liked the fact that the leads are also singers and not just acting. A cute modern twist to a fairytale. They even sang the perfect so perfectly. Why didn’t they just set this in modern times? What a warped postmodern revision of the past. Nice movie great actors that can sing too my kids love it and better than old dull versions  “Even magic has its limits” \n*Me, a writer writing a story with magic that has no limits*: Maybe I should take his advice ️ I can\'t wait for tomorrow it is going to release thank you for making the trailer yay I am excited  I kinda liked that Cinderella represented a hidden strength meaning that she was quiet and reserved but she had loads of patience and kindness towards those who deserved it rather than the usual bold and sassy hero that every feminist character has to have. It\'s very limited and stereotypical when ur female characters are all the same. Idk how to explain but this movie doesn\'t seem to have what I always liked about Cinderella. Cinderella is strong just not in the conventional way. Camilas singing gave me literal goosebumps and shivers. I can\'t wait to watch it<3 I just watched this and it was so good Ah yes of course, the fairy god mother is a gay black man, EXACTLY like how i remember it from my childhood Okay, I agree that in just 3 minutes I felt like I\'ve watched the whole movie. It would\'ve been better just to show some interesting scenes. However, I appreciate that they add some value on it\'s like, ""Chasing your Dreams first then Love"". With regards to Shawn as Camila\'s Prince, it could be interesting yeah but I\'m glad that they let Camila shine on her own, and the role fits for her - at first, I\'m kinda skeptical but she nailed it all the way through.  Lastly, it would be just fantastic if James Corden was the fairy godmother though and I\'m waiting for some interesting characters and like Pierce Brosnan? wow cool. You know there is a very clear difference between pushing boundaries and humiliating yourself right? Cinderella is not just a romance movie it teaches patience and humbleness inspite of how someone treats you because in the end you earned it Absolutely loved it  The fact that Camille is the main act here, then I love it the most  Even magic has limits hahahaha that killed me Ok I’m currently watching it and loving it  maybe everyone won’t like it but it defo has an Ella enchanted feel to it  Surprised they didn\'t have her aspire to be an ""influencer"". How come everyone is talking about the rest of the cast but not even the main character? I love camilla so much I\'m so excited for this movie to come out After how she was treated, I\'m for Camila rising in her own way. Love it. But wasn\'t expecting another Cinderella film. Her being the lead and all the funnies make it a tad manageable. Can\'t wait for this to come out! Looks amazing  The only one first Cinderella movie would always be my bias because \nIt\'s more contains moral learning\'s and love the arrangements of the booming scenes. i just watched the movie. guys believe me that was freaking insane. best one ever. OMG camila is killing it. i could watch that all again for billions of time. woah I think it\'s a amazing movie telling young passionate girls to follow their dreams, telling them they can have their opinions and they can achieve everything they want. This movie just wiped off my whole love for cinderella....\nIts just my opinion...\nI think I have to see disney\'s Cinderella ones again to get back the real feeling and love for ella Oh c\'mon, it was so beautiful!! Stop spreading hatred! I cried in overwhelming happiness after seeing this movie! It was beyond perfect! I just know the original Cinderella is rolling in her grave rn This was an amazing movie y\'all\nYes the original one was wayy better but this wasn\'t bad\nMost of the reviews i read were about how camila wasn\'t a good actor or that they shouldn\'t have had a man in a dress\nI personally thought camila was not that bad and Fab g was amazing Looks like I’m gonna like this new take on Cinderella! This movie is really good breakin some of the stereotypes of the movie cinderella and if the did some changes according to modern society and thinking nothing\'s wrong in it , i think its good tht they got something differently out from a old fairytale .... I like this summary type trailers. It saves me a lot of time. ""A 1 dimensional line in 3d space is still a line, it doesn\'t become a cube""\n""You cannot give more depth to Cinderella, and expect it to work"" “I was just singing and crying about it.” Self-aware huh? Let’s see how well this works. Just completed watching the film. Must say it shows true women empowerment. Loved the story, the drama, the culture and the out of box thought behind the film. The story, the song, the plot twist. I love it!!!! Just finished it. Iam helped out, thanks everyone involved! <3 ni siquiera pude superar a la primera de la cenicienta donde trabajaba la hermosa de Lily James y ahora me traen esta, voy a llorar de la emoción!!! I\'m gonna be honest guys... the 50\'s do look better sometimes. \nThey objectively weren\'t, but some things make them look better. I love this!!! The settings, the soundtrack, the costumes, the actors, the message...\nI can\'t wait to watch this movie. Repeating this movie 6 times  Looks like a lot of fun for an age group that I no longer belong to WHY??????? We have a perfectly amazing live Cinderella already!! ?? I love the way camilla acted!️ Camila did a great job!  I feel like I watched the whole movie from the trailer but I love it and who doesn\'t already know the story? Can\'t wait to watch it, even if for James Acaster as a mouse alone  I feel like Hollywood literally just crunches numbers to see if they can squeak by on any profit while putting out minimal effort. The ultra woke saturation and lack of originality  is outpacing satire at this point. Camila es el claro ejemplo que los sueños si se cumplen. LA AMO I\'m so excited to watch Cinderella haha. This is something different, it\'s more lively scene than the original. I want to see this! \nDidn’t even know Camilla acted HER SINGING IS SO SO GOOD- : 1:53 Producer Guy: ""So do you have a movie for me?""\nWriter Guy: ""Yes Sir! I do!""\nProducer Guy: ""What\'s the movie?""\nWriter Guy: ""So I was thinking of re-telling the Cinderella story"" Ah finally someone told that, wearing glass shoes not comfortable.. love it   At this point it looks like they ran out of movie ideas and they just said ""screw this, we\'re making another Cinderella movie"" Plus, no freaking dream is worth pursuing if it means giving up on love!!! Anyone remember the princess and the frog? Moral of the story people! \nTiana: my daddy never did get what he wanted... But he had what he needed! He had LOVE! He never lost sight of what was important! And neither will I! I feel like we should come together as a community and create new fairy  tales Honestly if Camilla was a Disney princess (I know this is Amazon; not Diseny) I wouldn’t see her as Cinderella but someone else. She still did a fair job tho Such a great movie with great acting:)!!!!! I may have to watch this I am seriously stoked who\'s playing the Fairy Godmother I have been following that man since the first time I saw him on that Netflix show pose When you change a story too much the spark just goes away. just watched it and it was honestly rlly good I should have watched the trailer, didnt know it was a musical so I could not finish it but seems nice for people who like them. Enjoy! Excelente parodia humorística de toda la cultura progresista, imposible tomarla en serio For the passed few years I\'ve shunned all new Hollyweird/Disney nonsense and just bought the classics on DVD. My goodness are they great. The time invested into story telling back then is part of its charm. I won\'t be tuning into what ever these weirdos are selling. The handmaid\'s tale\nAnne with an E \nThe remake of the winx\nThis ....etc  can’t they come up with a new, original movie idea? we’ve seen way too many cinderella stories :’) I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!!!!! Orgullosa de nuestra princesa Latina Camila es una muestra fehaciente de que nuestros sueños se cumplen si trabajamos en ellos  why not make a live action \'the princess and the frog\'  or \' the little mermaid \' or even \'Pocahontas\' \nthey\'re equally as iconic and would be much more appreciated rather than another Cinderella live action Theres a reason why it is sent straight to Prime Video. Becasue if they release it in Cinemas, I guarantee you there won\'t be a huge turnout Amazon: We made a Cinderella movie!\nMe: Wow, that sounds interesting. Might check it out\nAmazon: Featuring James Cor-\nMe:  N O She spent weeks making a beautiful dress and she just splatters ink on it I have saw the movie that was amazing  I love the movie I\'m in love with this because is a completely different version of Cinderella\'s story Me encantó ️ Love it  What a great rewrite of an old popular story replacing with good ideas............. The moral is "" girl or boy has access to catch their dreams.... Only things you need is a deep desire and pure heart ""........\nDifferent from those cliche poor girl is going to get heaven at Royal palace if she could meet the prince at the ball......... She is a real Cinderella  Love that song which Camila sings at the end “Yeah I was just crying and singing about it like two minutes ago” lmaooo that’s already my favorite line and the movie hasn’t even come out yet and that song “if it’s a million to one I’m gonna be that one and they’re gonna know my name” is already my fav song its good if they use known songs instead of unknown. i love when ella and robert sings Perfect by Ed Sheran. It\'s just the greatest movie I\'ve ever watched ️️️ , just finished now and came here... feeling so good and inspired to follow my dreams... whole movie is about chasing dreams, speaking free, and love and feel great to be a woman.\nJust wanna say that this movie is ️️️\nIt\'s just like a dream at the end. Idk, why but I got goosebumps  This is beautiful, everyone has their opinions and everyone is going to criticize according to their perspective and that\'s fine, personally I love the trailer and I know I will love the movie and not only because the beautiful Camila Cabello comes out but because it makes me feel to think about the Cinderella that I saw as a child having a prince charming and an old fairy, I always hoped that my fairy would save me as a child, I entered high school and wanted my prince, I mean the Cinderella that I met as a child looks like my life span of girl and now that I am 20 years old WOW ""I will fight for my dreams and for the things I love, today there will not be a fairy godmother to save me, today I saved myself with my God by the hand, they broke my heart for wanting a dressed toad as a prince, but this movie fits into my life today, my adult version, funny, cute, with anti-lowering but that everything has a solution and that my prince will arrive, without looking for him, only when he has to arrive "" Never in a million year would I have predicted Camila was going to be Cinderella Million to One lyrics goes along with Camila’s real life  one new remake of a classic per 20 years (minimum) is enough, thanks :[ The fact that this isn\'t the first adaptation of Cinderella to use ""Somebody to love"" is funny to me. Ella Enchanted, anyone? Amo o trabalho de Camila Cabello, suas músicas. E agora interpretando ficou lindo demais seeing this movie is like watching scary movie instead of  watching  some thriller movies ... overall its fun to watch and the singers are awesome... Am I the only one who sees the contraction when the whole theme is ""I\'m starting a dress making business i don\'t need a man"" but then a man helps her get ready for the ball How did we go from masterworks of fairytale retellings like ""Ever After"", ""Snow White: tale of terror"", and ""Company of Wolves"", to this? What happened? A remake that nobody asked for...according to critics...and it seems to be fine How nice it would be if Shawn Mendes plays the Prince character. Omg the outfits  are so good,i just can\'t wait I actually liked the godmother\'s sass. My problem was Camila\'s hair was a mess the whole movie, they didn\'t even transform it during the godmother scene. It was always a disaster. In 2021 seems ""Go Woke Go Broke"" is still a trend, good job Deserve ito ng part 2 Glad to see my ""James Corden movies always suck"" rule still applies Pierce Brosnan is still killin\' it. Espectacular  que maravilla que bien echo,  que voces asta el rey .jajajaja  el príncipe  no me gusta mucho  porque es el prototipo típico pero en plan divertido muy bueno.... Me gusta más el pelos en la cara  del amigo... I have watched this movie nd it is awesome Imagine taking an ancient traditional tale from a foreign country and changing everything about it.\nSome would call it cultural appropriation, but I guess that\'s only used when it\'s useful ""Even magic has its own limits"" This looks like Disney’s Cinderella meets Ella Enchanted. 80 percent on rotten tomatoes.  Way to go Camila !!  Great job. It looks spectacular !!  A dream musical fairy tale full of magic, songs and color.\nAnd that feminist touch that Ella wants to follow her dreams and achieve it by herself, which updates the tale.\nCamila was born to be Cinderella \nAnd besides her a whole cast of first: Idina Menzel, Pierce Brosnan, Billy Porter, Minnie Driver, James Corden...  Trailer alone is so empowering already! Can\'t wait! Oooo I’m waiting so much , I hope idina have some songs here, her voice is magical ️\u200d️ Me: omg there is cinderella 2021!\ndiscovers its a musical\nMe: oh nevermind... Hope we get to hear Beverley knight sing in this one of the uks powerhouse vocalist Honestly just waiting for a remake of hunchback of notre dame, atlantis, and emperor\'s new groove  The production design feels a teensy but inconsistent, but Billy Porter and Idina Menzel have piqued my interest. I LOVE THE LOOK OF THIS HAHA LOVE LOVE Don\'t know why but the mouse who falls over without his tail gets me all the time.  The fact that Pierce Brosnan is in this seals the deal. I watched this a few days ago, it was awesome! I absolutely love the songs. This girl ""Camilla"" is going to hit in the cinemas with her new talent... Very excited to watch this movie.. surely she\'s going to rock.. A dude as a very godmother?  I will never watch this nor will my kids. \n\nThe 2015 version will always be the best live action version. Plot twist: James Corden is the true villain. The only reason I watched this is because of Billy. I fast forwarded so many times lol This movie was awesome and the ending was so much better than the original or remakes Idk why people are hating on this so much lmao have you all watched the other cinderella movies? It looks like a fun silly movie, no need to hate on it so much Can\'t wait for tommorow  The cinderella with brandy will forever be my favorite if amazon wanted to do a \'brave and stunning\' take on cinderella, they should\'ve had her work in one of their sweetshops.   the fairy godmother could be a union rep and the prince is an antitrust lawyer. Just rented a private theater for my nieces 10 birthday party with 10 screaming girls & this movie is adorable.  A fun version for the kids.  Idina played a Wicked evil villain role and Camila is an absolute gem.  I have a crush on Camila after this movie!  Great kids movie. I´M SO PROUD OF CAMILA. MY TEARS They should\'ve released this in December. It has a Christmas feel to it... Itz awesome they nailed it  Thanks I just watched the whole movie in 3 minutes saved me some time bye I just watched this and lemme say, camila did a great job ️ THIS MOVIE IS SO GEEKY QUIRKY, LOVED IT. How dare yall rate this low I’m so sick of these Hollywood remakes that take everything that made the originals special and turn it into woke garbage. This is why woke go broke  Best Cinderella was Brandy and Whitney Houston’s version! Wow.. it looks like this is a continuation of the 2015 Cinderella story, played by Lily James and Richard Chemistry..  I remember when I was little I constantly watched the Cinderella movie with Selena Gomez. I fuckin loved it and still do. Looks like a new, trendy, liberal interpretation. I predict it will do as well as the last “Cats” (widely panned and a major Hollywood failure).   \nI’ll take the more traditional versions, thank you. How many Cinderella movies do we need?? One every few years I guess? Aquí es donde los camilizers estamos orgullosos de Karla Camila,de lo que ha logrado y va a lograr I get they’re trying to go with more of a girl boss Cinderella who just wants to make dresses, but that doesn’t help that we kinda just saw that storyline a bit with Vanessa during the In The Heights film when they gave her the story of wanting to be a fashion designer… I mean I guess you can still argue that she still wanted to be with the main guy in the process. Bravo, brava ♡ Loved It! Cinderella movies should be a way to count time\n"" how many Cinderella movies are you ?"" \n""three"" Amei o novo musical I SO love this ""Cinderella"" \nIDKY The best part of this trailer, they made the gown like a glass which is the real Cinderella gown unlike the movie which is blue. the first version of cinderella was the best, can\'t change my mind ""do you wanna dance""\n""right now?!""\nNo. Next week, in your basement Can\'t wait for this!!!! Just watched this and it was SO GOOD! I loved the music and dancing and everything really. People don\'t knock  it without giving it a chance. WOKE cinderella was very entertaining Walt Disney would look at this and laugh I didn’t like the movie but I did enjoy Camila’s singing  I don\'t know why people are not liking this film like I truly enjoyed this film SO PROUD OF HER I AM SO EXCITED!!!  I would rather watch a live action version of Anastasia. The most underrated dinsey princess ever. So to love someone, have a need to be with somebody special it\'s a old dasty thing nowadays. \nI\'m so glad in my childhood we watched another movies and believed we\'ll meet our special one. I got married to the wonderful men who supports my career. You can raise children and have career (I have 3 children). No need to choose. Really.. Too bad for our children. They think it\'s impossible. I just watched it! It’s so Amazing! I Highly Recommend it! GOOSEBUMPS Ppl who say this movie is not good at all go watch it first it\'s ACTUALLY really nice if u don\'t want to then just tell me I\'ll spoil the whole thing for ya Now I had to rewatch Cinderella 2015 to forget this thing happened Just finished watching it and it is sooooo goooooddd This movie is really awesome and superb Camila is superb no words to say guys I cant see another version of Cinderella after watching Lily James and Cate Blanchett version! HAVE COURAGE AND BE KIND ️ - I ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS QUOTE FROM CINDERELLA 2015 ️️️️️️ THANK YOU LORD JESUS ️️️️️️ Extended title: how to ruin the original cinderella by making a non reasonable live action one even tho it didn’t need one I\'ve seen every single Cinderella movies. And though Cinderella might be the overdone princess with numerous of movie adaptations, I still watch every single one of it. She\'s my favorite princess after all. But among all the Cinderella movies, I only like two of them: \'A Cinderella Story\' with Hilary Duff and \'Ella Enchanted\' with Anne Hathaway.  I’m going to watch it today in the movie theatre I’m so excited!!\n\nUpdate: It was amazing ! Idina Menzel: you can’t just marry a man you just met!\nAlso Idina Menzel: marry him and all our problems will be solved  Can\'t wait  Plot twist: Prince Charming is not into Cinderellas. Robin Hoods are more of his type. Ah yes, Kay Cannon, the producer of classic hits such as GirlBoss, How To Be Single, Pitch Perfect, and Baby Mama. A prodigy, that one. very best form of Cinderella  \nyou got me Camila\nI wonder why ppl dont love this version \nwe can feel another side of Cinderella ( ella) in this and I got so much strength and had fun . Salute to all ppl who made this  Are we really need new Cinderella movie almost every year? Seriously? I think 1950 and 2015 were good enough :D ""I have a dream that I have to chase""\n\nInspiring IM CRYING!! IM SO PROUD OF MY IDOL I can\'t wait 2021 just let out the epitome within just 3 minutes WHAT A TWIST! WONDERFUL! GOOSEBUMPS Camila Cabello and Idina Menzel?  There is going to be lots of singing involved, that\'s a guarantee !!!  Oh, and I love Billy Porter as the fairy grandmother.  I\'m sure he will sing too. This was amazing. I don\'t care that Cinderella has dark hair or that the fairy godmother is male (honestly, he\'s one of my favourite characters) she\'s not the girl that relies on a husband and swoons when she sees the prince. This is pretty much the whole movie  Billy Porter was amazing in this musical and his voice was so Grrrrreat!!!! Love this version of Cinderella and how the characters put their twist on the characters. This gives away the entire movie I really expected to be that farmer boy in the middle of the film would be able to unite with that daughter of the stepmother at the end of the video.Anybody agree with me? the little whispered ""right now?"" that she did omg i love it I like the modern dance routines, but I wish they would have stuck closer to the original, classic story This looks like someone\'s fanmade Cinderella movie you\'d find on YouTube Now before I go any further I have to say that since The Greatest showman hit the screens and oh what a godsend feelgood movie that was, it seems most modern musicals have taken that inspiration and a welcome one it is to with the likes of Hamilton, In the Heights, Dolly Partons Christmas movie and so on.. It reminds me my golden childhood \nNow I can die I peace  ตั้งแต่ดูซินเดอเรล่ามา ชอบเวอร์ชั่นนี้ที่สุดเลย มันแปลกกว่าเวอร์อื่นดี Oh well, at least they save the final plot twist for the actual movie. Part 2 guys we all want part 2!!! THIS LOOKS AMAZING CAMILA’S ACTING IS GREAT JUST FROM THE TRAILER Would LOVE to have Kevin Samuels take on this. It seems like this movie\'s only redeeming quality is having James Acaster in it. But judging from this trailer, it barely does. This is the best movie ever This would be cool if they’d actually cast the fairy godmother as a woman. Or, if they’re going to cast her as a man, then actually genderbend her into a “fairy godfather”. Like, for real, it’s okay for a guy to be gay and dress flamboyantly while still identifying as male. This godmother gives you a pair of Jordans instead of high heals I\'m wheezing at how realistic this Cinderella\'s lines are.  NO BUT I DIDN""T REALISE ROMESH AND JAMES WOULD BE THIS BIG OF CHARACTERS!! this is the coolest thing ever. The way he said even magic has it’s limits makes my day wauw we just saw the whole movie in three minutes I LOVE the fact that they openly admitted ""A new bold take"" instead of trying to redo the original. This seems like it\'s definitely going to be good and funny while also being practical! I love Camilla\'s singing but I\'m not sure about the acting part...also we already have like a dozen of these cinderella movies and it\'s getting kinda tiring I love how the stepmother encourages her to many him. She\'s actually supportive of her stepdaughter for once.  GUyss it\'s finally out !!! amazingg moviee must watch very veryy positve and less depressin than the actual storyy love the way it\'s potrayed and amaazing work by Camila and i\'m in love with the step mom she is also really refreshing and is a wonderful charecter. pls stop the hate and just give this masterpiece a tryy!! Seeing James Corden makes the movie 10% cringy, but would love to see the many representations in this movie! I just finished watching this modernized rendition of the classic tale... and loved every second of it!  ️ I always wanted this kind of fairy tale when I was child. It will be inspiring for new generation. I couldn\'t keep a straight, or smiley face the whole movie. Lol I enjoyed it. Yes, it was cheesy, and not the best version. But it was a nice ""musical"", and the cast was good. It delivers the message of being yourself in a simple way. Score: 7/10. James Corden who produced this movie; he was perfect for Peter Rabbit to bring the character to life. I bless him for his other roles as the Baker in Into the Woods and Biggie in the Trolls series right after he hosted his own show. i’m actually excited for this story!! i actually don’t know how it’s gonna end This adds up to the ""Originals"" section on Amazon prime. So I am sitting here watching Cinderella and I\'m smiling from ear to ear because there is an Ed Sheeran song in the movie.  If you had told 15 year old Camila Cabello that she would grow up to have a successful Grammy nominated music career and be in a musical where she sings an Ed Sheeran song she would probably have never believed it.  She was such a big fan of his growing up. I am so happy for her. I have finally watched it.. Such a masterpiece! And great job done by you all️ After watching it to the end I was just living thinking about this movie all the time... BTW It really surprised me when PERFECT was played Perfect song is perfect to be played for that Ball Dance youre a legend camila Это лучшая фея-крёстная в истории! xDD Not gonna lie, this plot of Cinderella being a designer and having to choose between a man and her career is sooooooooo unexpected!\nI’m actually pretty impressed with this.\n NEWSFLASH - She can have it ALL, at the same time  BASICALLY...*THE CINDERALLA STORY WE DESERVED* I\'m not gonna lie the amount of second hand embarassment I\'ve got watching this movie is just ... I was cringing the whole time This reminds me of that movie ""Cats"" and we all know how that went.... I feel sorry for the actual woman actress who lost the role of fairy godmother to a man in drag. People should learn to accept the changes. it just an another version and people should respect that. Just a new thing and love their acting and enjoy the movie it instead of bashing it . so excited to see camila, she\'s so talented I\'ve seen Cabello singing in cut scenes from the movie and sliding buck nekked down a mile long ramp of broken glass would be less painful.  My kids can be traumatized by this without me. Every day we inch closer and closer to living in the Hunger Games. Looks more interesting than the original story itself  This movie is really so inspiring!! This movie shows that time as changed where Cinderella -THE every girl will choose their dream, their self instead of choosing a boy who just wants to you his or the freaking love. \nThank you so much Amazon to have this movie to see me This movie is like everything wrong with the world put in one OMG the movie is just so different than what I expected. Totally different thinking about women. I JUST LOVED IT! Worth watching!!! Go stream it now. I get the point.... but honestly from Cinderella of 2015   there wasnt needed for more live actions... to me that was already the best one “Anyway to make them more comfortable?”\n\n“No!” 0:41 ok this and the whole idea of “cinderella but mixing it with modern elements and humor, and oh it’s a musical” has literally been done before, its a spectacular movie AND ITS CALLED ELLA ENCHANTED A great fun remake of an old fairytale. Lovely lead actors, good singing and love Camila and Nick. My children keep watching this over and over again singing and dancing to the songs. Love James Cordon too!! It\'s good\nI enjoyed it The ""old lady"" godmother was adorable  The sole selling point for me is that James Acaster is in this film omg I am looking forward to this movie. Camila does it spectacular Do they really think children want to hear about the glass slipper being uncomfortable or metanarrative jokes? Are they trying to destroy any sense of whimsy/magic? Just watched the crosswalk musical of james. He\'s literally a rat in this movie.  ""Even magic has its limit."" sooo beautiful ️ Why everyone hating this movie?I mean I already watched it and it\'s  really good and funny at the same time not the literal cinderella story  yall watched but I think it\'s really good featuring a strong independent woman who had a dream not to mention she chose to be a designer over a princess cuz she dont want to live in that kind of life YES YES YESS, I\'M SO EXCITED AND PROUD OF CAMILA Music we know from Queen, Madonna, Earth Wind and Fire, Janet Jackson, plus newer and original music? Broadway style dancing?  If you like broadway musicals, this is for you.  Best lighthearted musical since Jingle Jangle. Skip the preview if you don\'t want to see the entire movie in 3 minutes. And it\'s about the singing, dancing, musicians and costumes. A better name for the movie would be ""Ella.""  If you are looking for Cinderella, watch the old Disney movie. I’m so proud of Camila️ and this movie looks spectacular ️ Debes saber que el amor nos salvará ️ This looks like a fun one to watch Okay this is getting old. The only part of this trailer that I actually enjoyed was the godmother part (Yes I’m one of the few people who enjoyed it) but other than that I can’t see myself watching this. We have a Cinderella movie every 3 years. It’s time they come up with a new Disney princess movie or make a real life version of others. Never will be watching this. SWEET yet another woke remake I cant wait to never see. this is a whole different person i would rather watch the master piece cinderella (2015) cus its the best cinderella movie for me I like it when he says \'even magic has it\'s own limits\'  I just cant have enough cinderella movies. I really like their soundtrack too! What a bold take. Whoever wrote this must be so, so proud. i like the musical as its own. I just don\'t like that it uses cinderella as a front honestly but the whole concept is still good Amazing!!! Theres not even a question on what the ending will be I hate that there\'s another one of these, but I can appreciate Camilla Just watched, so amazing! I\'ll be watching again! This movie was everything. I loved it !! Wydawałoby się zwykła czynność. Wybrać film by obejrzeć z dzieckiem. Teraz to nie takie proste. Trzeba najpierw samemu obejrzeć lub oglądać tylko takie sprzed laty. Z Panem Bogiem wszystkim This is a cinderella story that i have always wanted to see. Thanks for making this movie. Am soo happy for cinderella not settling for someone who just chooses you with help of a shoe!!?? OMG!! i love this trailer!!! Change is happening!!! The Disney live-action Cinderella is the best one yet with the animated trilogy. Camila Cabello could be the future wife of Shawn Mendes. Idina Menzel appeared in Enchanted and voiced Elsa already. Minnie Driver originally voiced Jane Porter; I\'ll hire her to voice Agatha Hobbs. THIS MOVIE LOOKS SO GOOD OMG I CAN\'T WAIT It’s funny how no one ever asks men to choose between marriage and their career.  She could still make dresses as a princess- this a very contrived conflict. Finally someone addressed the issue of the ""uncomfortable glass slippers"" (they are heels btw). I mean this is going to be one of my favs for sure Everything was great, the singing the dancing the dresses the acting the story line. i never watched cinderella movies, but its always has been a musical? loved this its on Prime Stop taking things so seriously..... This movie was enjoyable, fun, colorful... like most cinderella movies....\nOr I am just hopeless on these but I can watch so many cinderella versions backtoback ... and not get bored. \nThis was ok too. At least I did not went into it with super high expectations . I liked the actors, the songs,the story changes here and there. I am Joey. All the layers are good... but I guess there will be people who think otherwise. And that is ok too. There is no way in hell this like dislike ratio is accurate. Talk about sus Amazon. Elsa in frozen:\n""You can\'t merry a man you\'ve just met!""\n\nEvil Elsa in this new Cinderella: Cinderella 2015 has set the bar too high for me. No other cinderella movies adaptation can appeal to me now. Omg I freaking loved this Movie Camila was awesome Loved her.  Every was amazing.   Loved Fairy Godmotha Billy Porter Fabulous. I wish Shawn Mendes was the lead actor.  Would\'ve completed the movie.  It still was an amazing movie \'The Legend you know, the story you don\'t\'  Wasn\'t that the tagline for the 2018 Robin Hood film? That turned into being the story we all knew far too well.......and the film bombed I love how AMAZON made a movie where a woman wnats to WORK instead marry a prince. Gold. The \'\'godmother\'\' sealed the deal for me,think i\'ll pass This is a good film. Now I’m gonna start by saying I’m not a theatre kid just a normal amount of musical interest. So im going to be honest, this film wasn’t perfect, the lip syncing wasn’t great at times and the cringe was real at moments but overall this film was a good watch. I loved James Acaster, James Corden and Romesh Ranganathans performance as well as Tom Becket some good laughs came from them and I like how the songs weren’t entirely new and original I already knew the beat and some of the lyrics and enjoyed singing along! I wasn’t overly fussed by the switch in storyline I didn’t hate it I didn’t love it. I don’t really believe that’s what love is, love is giving yourself up because the other person is important like the prince does but hay ho it doesn’t ruin the film and does have some good themes throughout for youngsters to learn from. Give it a watch, give it a pinch of salt it’s not perfect but neither are you. At the end of the day It made me smile. If there\'s a negative rating for a movie this one would deservedly take it I start laugh ..when the cinderella comes.. hahahaha funny.. i will see it.. A super fun version for all to enjoy This belongs up there with the greats! Aeroplane, hotshots, naked gun, scary movie, you name\'em. todos por favor a apoyarla, tendremos a Camila como protagonista ️️️ The only reason I even watched the trailer was to catch a glimpse of James, James and Romesh  Imagine that prince singing ""don\'t go yet don\'t go yet"" when she leaves the castle  I just watched the movie.... I tell you guys .... It\'s got Camilla belting out her vocals, lots of humor. Think Havana vibes packaged into a almost two hour entertainment. And the music covers. A nice trip down memory lane with our favorite songs..... Overall..... They did a great job telling us the classic story Excited! We\'re going to watch a whole different phase of Cinderella-the independent one! I need to watch \'Ever After\' (1998) after this. It calls itself soooooooo different but still she ends up with the price  How about we just come up with new stories?? LEAVE OUR CLASSICS ALONE!! props to them for letting the godmother me a guy, and for cinderella saying “i don’t want a life waving from a royal box anymore then being confided to a basement” Just watched, and although I actually really enjoyed it, I couldn’t stand Camilla Cabello’s singing, it was like listening to a hyper chipmunk with bad auto tune ️ Idina smashed it though.  Loved the Fabulous Godmother  YOOO THIS MOVIE WAS DOPE. Fantastic, humorous, enjoyable! I pity those who look down on this Cinderella adaptation even before watching the whole thing. Those people are missing a lot and you are embarrassing yourselves by saying trashy things to what you haven’t even witnessed yet. I think her stepmother is Suit for Antagonist in Tangled action movie , I can be excited if Rafonzel will be next at this matter.... Coming from a woman that chased the career route and gave up on love.  Err wrong, wrong in so many ways.  Material things come and go but love, real true love is priceless and it\'s worth the sacrifice. Wow, what a MUST MISS! not a fan of camila but she does have amazing singing voice Her emotion when she started singing....\n\nChills...literal chills Amazing!!!!! Love the ideas, the film looks great, but why you need to keep calling every goddamn princess Cinderella?\nMarketing rules the world I guess.... I think whoever read the story before making this script probably passed out half way through ""fairy godmother"". OMG I LOVE IT I\'m sorry, but I\'m all just excited thinking James will make a Cinderalla musical Crosswalk for this!! Please tell me theyre making it! Oooooh I know what I\'m watching for my next movie night ...!!!! This looks fun\n\nor at least I would if y\'all let us rent prime videos. I\'m not interested in subbing. OK anyone saying this new version of Cinderella wanting to make it on her own and has amazing pop songs needs to revisit Ella Enchanted with Anne Hathaway- they even used the same song Somebody to love Fantastic.This Cinderella movie is very different more than other Cinderella movies .It makes me so laugh. Who else wishes Shawn was the prince   Feel bad for the kids now not knowing the real cinderella rip  This made cinderella in another level! Loving it!! Please stream this album I was like ""y\'all doing idina menzel DIRTY by making her evil step mother"" then I googled her age and she\'s FIFTY???? jesus christ I thought she\'d be in her late 30s at most she looks fantastic Love this, Cuban Cinderella and a man as the “godmother” Cuban representation and lgbtq\nrepresentation. And honestly, love this. Definitely going to give it a watch! OF COURSE JAMES CORDEN IS IN THIS this remake is soooo good actally its look good and i will watch it This is EVERYTHING!! Can\'t wait to see Camila acting  I\'m gonna rewatch the Brandy and Whitney version. They did Asian representation before it was cool The story is not just about to becoming a princesse, well it is more than that This is like a very long tiktok video that no one asked for. Give them some original tracks for the love of GOD! This movie was honestly surprisingly enjoyable How can we hide this to our future generation? A Disney princess movie not made by Disney?\nI\'m in! My favorite Ella story <3 I’d never seen such a backwards and confused step-mother. The only one that told her to actually marry the prince  2020’s children talking about Cinderella: \n\nKid: Yes I loved Cinderella\nAdult: That fairy god mother was just delightful  This looks so good, I’m so excited! Idk why people are hating on this movie, I watched it and tbh it isn\'t anything special but still it isn\'t bad so.... All you need in this world is rich parents or a rich husband so you can follow your dreams  I love Camila Cabello but goddamn! They could have picked some Cinderella retelling or fanfic and it still would have been better than this! I thought it was a parody, wish it was! This looks great! I\'m excited to see this. i dont really understand the hate, yes as cringey and silly as it was, i think the point of this was just a cheesy take on the cinderella movie. i actually enjoyed the movie, and i thought camila was very wonderful in it. and she did a pretty good job as this is her first acting debut. gold star for her. I\'m highly agitated that they would screw this story up. I feel like vomiting seeing the fairy godmother.  They went the real fairy route with that part. I love this new story of Cinderella. Romance and Career, who says you cant have it both? Love love love it Billy porter as fairy godmother is the best thing that ever happened to any Cinderella I WANT THE BLONDE CINDERELLA. Cinderella went from reading books to becoming a fashion designer.  Wtf. Don\'t we already have a wayyy better cinderella movie? I love it Yeah... I’m just gonna keep enjoying Disney’s Cinderella, Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella, and Ever After instead. Lol I\'m all for changes and stuff, but this movie (and the other fairy tale movies) makes me want to re-watch the fairy tale movies from my childhood. \n\nThe black gay man is way-over-the-top, the man is so..present..your stereotypical \'faboulous\' gay person. There are gay people that looks just like you and me you know. As if they made a combox2 pleasing. This \'Cinderella\' is an businesswoman in a FAIRY TALE, no just no! Did you guys knew the writer of this Cinderella 2021 was the same as pitch perfect I feel that she will not marry the prince, she is gonna get married to a Musician ️I wished it was set in a Castillian backdrop (like Ever After), but this is fine! Why are y\'all so serious in the comment section for!? This is a light-hearted movie that also empowers women, and encourages people to follow their dreams. It\'s okay if they changed some of the elements from the classic fairytale. Y\'all be acting like boomers who doesn\'t like when things change or when people are open-minded. NoneNoneme before the trailer: do we really need another Cinderella movie?\nme after the movie:  We really did not need another Cinderella movie. I literally watched the whole movie I 2 minutes. Thank you I  grew up with Cinderella and the fairytale story.i get that women are now working women with ambitions and that we need to have more acceptance of the LGBT community but this was a classic. This story represents a time in life. Cinderella wanting to please a prince back in the day when a woman\'s livelihood depended on it was just so exciting . And a cute love story k.Believe me when I say watching Cinderella did not cause me to not have any ambition. I\'m sure even gays could watch the original and feel get fantasy love story vibe. It was amazing. They should have just made a whole new story instead of acting like there was something wrong with the old version. Drew Barrymore (Ever After) will always be my Cinderella. I\'m 99% certain the only part left out in the trailer is that the prince turns out to be gay, comes out in a song and ends up wearing a pride flag inspired outfit designed by Cinderella in the opening of her fashion house. And they live happily ever after. I guess they\'ll never stop ruining our old classic movies... “If it’s a million to one I’m gonna be that one and you’re gonna know my name”from X factor to Cinderella.,so proud of her 😭 Drew Barrymore and Lily James will always be my favorite Cinderellas If we\'re talking best Cinderellas it is a CRIME that no one\'s mentioning Brandy. I mean... Brandy will always be MY Cinderella. Okay this is completely different from the story we actually know and love. I’m actually kinda excited to see this movie. A kingdom ruled by a monarchy, a woman chasing her dream and her step mother will do anything to get her married to the prince. I love it I liked how they put classic songs like Shining Star from Earth, Wind and Fire into the movie and many more other songs. I think the movie was very entertaining you can\'t help yourself to sing along with the music. Gotta love WOKE, really what the world needs....\nWe sure don\'t need lower/less taxes, better paychecks, affordable housing etc etc....\n\nSo glad we got this WOKE stuff all around us, makes me forget life\'s struggles.... I\'m gay...but seriously do we really need to incorporate our self to anything just to feel we are accepted and acknowledge by society..?  It\'s starting to get bit out of hand! Lily James is still the one I like.. It follows the original story.. However, this one has changes and is more on a musical one, still nice and new ""Great theatre has never sought to purvey pure propaganda. It asks profound questions rather than gives pat answers"" --Robert Cohen, Donovan Sherman. \nAlthough this isn\'t technically theatre, it definitely has a lot of similarities. Thought this quote fits well with what is happening today. Sweet baby Jesus this looks absolutely atrocious Camila Cabello went from being with Fifth Harmony to going solo and now she is starting in her first movie called Cinderella and I am sure that she is perfect for this role and I am astonished that the audience will leave you in awe and wonder with this amazing song masterpiece. Just when i thought i had enough of this story getting retold over and over again…this shows up and im all for this one Didn’t we get a live action Cinderella a few years ago? The Musical seems to be the only thing will make this movie interesting Looks like a parody to Cinderella 😀 I really want to see this one! I think it\'s time to pay for Prime streaming again. This feels like Into the Woods meets Enchanted Ella meets Cinderella (Brandy). I think I\'ve seen most of the Cinderella remakes, and idk how I feel about this one. It seems silly while at the same time it\'s trying to make Cinderella someone career-focused. I guess I\'ll end up watching this too at one point, but yeah...it seems like we just got the whole movie from the trailer.... Oh my!! Aren’t there already enough cinderella films?? 🙄 2021 latest version I love this story because  as child I always listened ☺️☺️ It\'s like they sprinkled in a bit of The Greatest Showman. They\'re actually encouraging her to marry him??? That\'s an interesting take🤔 🥺🥺💕my opinion....\nReally miss the 2015 version so much \n, not to say I think camila is so pretty ....\nbut I think  lily james has became one of the most classic Cinderella of 21th centuries No matter how many times I have seen this story. \n\nI will definitely watch this one, the songs will be something 😍. Camila stands for Cinderella truly!! Only two word i want to say - can\'t wait ❤️ This movie is going to  BLOW Lily James Was the Best Cinderella Perfect!❤🌟✨ Sony outdid themselves with this version of Cinderella. Based on that 30 sec trailer, everything is amazing. The costumes, sets, songs, choreography and of course Camila Cabello is incredible. She carried that trailer like a big shining star! Not only does Camila is so pretty in the teaser but Billy Porter looks incredible & glowing in that role\nI\'m here for Billy Porter as the Fairy Godmother! 🖤🖤🖤❣❣ Can\'t wait 😁 Amazing 🤩 Creo que está me va a gustar más que la otra There\'s Camila and Idina Menzel...\nI\'m expecting a load of new awesome songs................... Camila QUEEN 💃🏻❤️🔥 Oh please, not another Cinderella story 🤦🏻\u200d♂️ I can\'t wait  . fantastic  😍  thank you 😍 YAAASSS CANT WAIT THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING Oh look! Another Cinderella movie! 😃😃 Beautiful film! Camila Cabello is my cinderella 🤗 James Corden...WTF? He\'s everywhere, damn it. Me encanta lo estoy esperando hace años y estoy a solo un mes  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Looking forward to the SONGS! We so need another cinderella movie its not like we have like 10 billion of them Love it already 😂 the mouse, the music, the fabulous godmother, this’s probable the most accurate Cinderella from disney version 😆 \nI hope they do something with the prince though, too much feminism usually equal bad movie :b the entire movie summarised in 3 minutes… I feel drained even watching the trailer... Not my cup of tea, I\'ll tell you that ☕👀 Im so excited! cant wait to hear Idina Menzel sing! I mourn for the day producers, editors, directors ,etc realise a little goes a long way. Putting spoilers in trailers is as pointless as watching the movie when it comes out after watching the trailer. Why don\'t they just change the name to Woke Cinderella There are only two Cinderellas in my heart: the original animated, and Brandy James Cordon kills every movie he stars in Can\'t wait for this film. I did think that this would be on Disney+ though. I love it when you call me senorita, I don\'t wanna pretend other than I am Ella.\nI am Ella.. la la.\nI am Ella.. la la...\nOoo.. everything, I love \'em. I wished they hadn’t shown the dress. The are no more surprises anymore gosh whyyyy Beautiful My baby 😭😭 I\'m here for my baby C , idina menzel and Billy Porter as the Fairy Godmother 😌🔥🔥\ncinderella comes out september 3rd 💜🥀💃 Imagine if the prince is shawn mendes hehe 😁🔥❤️ Out of all of the cinderella remake movies, I think this is going to be the best one. Well the 2 best one. the one with brandy was the best! :D Dude how many reboots will the Cinderella movie have Imagine this Cindrella singing in movie -\n\nHalf of my heart is in Havana , ooh nana yay\nHe took me back to east Atlanta, na na na, ah... Why doesn\'t anyone mentioning how beautiful songs this movie will have I\'m here for my baby C , idina menzel and Billy Porter as the Fairy Godmother 😌🔥🔥\ncinderella comes out september 3rd 💜🥀💃 I understand wanting to make a “woke” movie but why change a classic and why not just create a new movie to incorporate the new ways of society. I feel like this wasn’t their smartest move messing with peoples child hood movies and be a slippery slope and so far no one seems to hapoy with the changes. I edit myself into movies and TV shows with green screen and was thinking about editing myself into this movie!!!  Any movie suggestions would be great!! James Corden, playing Footmen / Mice, have done voice work in Sony Animation films: Corden voiced Hi-5 in The Emoji Movie (2017) and the title character of Peter Rabbit (2018). Omg yess Camilla Camila is perfect for this Im watching it more because of camilas vocals she has a great voice but the rest is just the same I\'m excited about this film and I love Billy porter Finally a real cindrella who can really sing.... It’s will be great adventure during Camila Cabello acting.😜 Haven\'t we already had one of these? this will be an iconic cinderella I believe you shld leave the fairytale to the original story rather than twisting it and turning it. I love this I bet that\'s the full dialogue, the rest is everyone breaking into song and driving you nuts. Camila gives more jasmine vibes than cinderella lmao Wow a classic story with a twist hope is good I love Camila, but this movie just looks like a modern parody in a different era. Disney\'s Cinderella with Lily James>>>>>>>>> Omg this movie is hilarious Disney did a live-action CINDERELLA not that long ago.  Why not make a live-action version of 2001\'s CINDERELLA II:DREAMS COME TRUE instead? This looks like fun. I can’t wait to hear Elsa sing here Well am glad I watched the preview.  I couldn\'t finish the movie Aladdin even though I was so excited when I first heard about it. I can tell I would probably stop watching this one too so I won\'t be wasting my time. If you want to shove your message down people throats... the least you can do is come up with your own movies instead of ruining classics 🔥🔥🔥🌹 Camila 🌹🔥🔥🔥 The castle movie looks different but magnificent in the weird looking fairy godmother   playing by man not liking it but the movie Cinderella I do like A black gay dude as the fairy godmother… what a load of woke bollocks. 100% happy with the fairy godmother Sony : Can I borrow Cinderella from u Disney?\nDisney : Sure, as long as u share Spidey. we got too many cinderella movies😭 Honest question: it\'s a fairy tail but doesn\'t Disney own the rights of... pretty much everything? Well Amazon could afford it if so I guess. I\'m glad it\'s not Disney though. i particularly like the action sequence @2:41.. Now give me back my 2 minutes, u can keep the 52. Peace😔 well here is another movie that didnt need to be made. I love this concept. Cinderella wants to become a businesswoman and follow her passion rather than getting the prince’s attention. Thanks for ruining childhoods with political agendas. Here\'s a crazy idea... Make NEW princesses for all the minorities you\'re trying to appease. Imagine that?! Wait a minute, didnt Kay Cannon say that the major twist of this movie was the step mother was nice ? Either im tone deaf or I specifically heard that Cannon say idina Menzel\'s character isn\'t a cruel step mother This is going to be a perfect movie The sound blaze lobb❤ pyaar A total abomination foisted on us by James Cordon who I personally think is Bi, but I could be wrong. 2015 Disney Cinderella with Lily James is the ultimate and will never be matched. Absolutely CLASSIC! Dube, no more Cinderella stories.It\'s become a fucking movie cliche on its own. I could only watch 45 seconds of this trailer. <\\\\\\ SO MUCH FANTASTIC AND COOL EXCELLENT WORK>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> So the new Cinderella does it on her own no prince needed.. great another woke remake Loved 3000x - Cinderella (2021) ✧ 𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐌𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐞 ✧\n——————————————————--\nWatch 👉 https://bit.ly/3haWod2 Why they making another live versions Cinderella. Like y’all could’ve did another Disney princess How many Cinderella story would they do Ok the first 10 seconds i was like who needs this? Just the classic Cinderella story.Then came the fairy godmother sceen and i was like ""fuck this, this is actually  not taking to seriously.This is fun. It\'s almost like Hollywood decided to mock their own wokeness these last years. It\'s so cringy it feels like one of the two: self mockery or total disconnection from reality. Godmother is a cosplay of Chris Tucker from Fifth Element. Cinderella (2021) 𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐇𝐃 𝟏𝟎𝟖𝟎\n𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 ➽ https://is.gd/lXUcrV The fairy godmother is a dude, got it. Makes sense. This movie is about as woke as it could possibly get🤦\u200d♀️ Cinderella (2021) 𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐇𝐃 𝟏𝟎𝟖𝟎\n𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 ➽ https://is.gd/lXUcrV I thought the Fairy GodMother was Fifth Element Chris Tucker Cinderella (2021) ✧ 𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐌𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐞 ✧\n——————————————————---\n👉 https://bit.ly/3kxD3Fk\n👉 https://bit.ly/3ilHksS I dont care if the characters are a different gender, race or anything this is going to be a good movie for me People need to stop remaking the classics. Yeah we all know the original story of Cinderella. These people aren\'t doing it justice. i’m so proud that cinderella is latina, wow! Camilla looks like sister of Yennefar.. from Witcher Wokerella in the land of absurd comercial decisions... 1:42 - a perfect example why you don\'t want commoners marrying into a royal family. They have no idea about the hard work, stress, responsibility for other people and grace it takes to rule, keep a country going. If she was more educated/smarter, she would have thanked the prince for the opportunity to give back to her people and her country and to secure their futures by giving the kingdom an heir and being a fair, attentive queen. She was wants to make dresses...obviously not a princess material. It\'s like she thinks that dressmaking is more important and rewarding that governing a nation. Maybe this is the first Cinderella movie where she doesn\'t take the prince at the end. She doesn\'t need a prince to be successful. Do we really need another fricking Cinderella Movie? \n""But it can be feminist now!"" \nEver After did it 23 years ago. And better. \n""Cinderella isn\'t a damsel--"" Why are you all commenting like this it’s an good movie Destroying the original idea about Cinderella Trailer as always shows everything. Also it is too over the top for me to enjoy it. If they wan\'t to redo old fairytale stories they should stay a little bit more truthful to the story. This is just too much. 💗 Why do they keep making Cinderella movies? They keep telling a tale and switching out details and trying to make it more modern and funny...\nIt seems pointless to me and I think the leading Cinderella is lily james by far! Is that a genie or a fairygod father??? SHE IS SO PRETTY WOW! New crush 😍 I think there might be something off about a God ""mother"" 💜 Trailer is enough for me James Corden in yet another musical, who would have expected that 🙄 ❤️ Oh my god this is so original. Of course in this weird crazy times, the good fairy must be a gay black guy 🙄 💖 ""Even magic has it\'s limits"" - like if you want to be a girl, than you still can\'t be a girl if you have born into a man\'s body... Disney:Let\'s make a movie\n20 years later\nDisney: Let\'s make it again but worse\nAmazon: hold my beer I am detecting hints and notes of Ella Enchanted 👃🤔😃\nI approve ... 1:23 I new that’s was James Corden in the first trailer! Forced racial diversity, forced sexual orientation diversity, bad rich white people....I suspect this movie will be more of lecture on the oppression of certain groups of people and the privilege of others and less about entertaining the viewers. Remember hilary duffs cinderella story you know the first and best modern one?\n\nAnd for classic you watch the disney animated original. Is that Camila☺️ no structure, no story, just cameos and cringe Bruh I wanna watch lol This is revolution in minds Oh, so this is Cinderella (diversity edition) 💛 ❣️ WOW.....over done, over blown and God help us.....James Corden.....again....Why?.....that man must have the best agent.....EVER 💚 People like to discuss the ""woke politics"" at play because Twitter has infected everything, but let\'s just recognize that the worst bits of casting in this movie are Camila Cabello and James Corden. Fine singers, horrid actors. Fall on your ass one more time, Corden, why don\'t you. i thought they were gonna do an actual version of cinderella with these actors.  Not that i care anyway but i notice themtwisting things and bending it to thier will.  a lot. To keep everything fair and woke - shouldn\'t Cinderella be re-cast as a man now - or...does it only work one way....? Well well well , what an awkward situation 🤨 I hate musicals but the plotline seems interesting Amazing Surprised that she is not black considering all that\'s going on recently. 💙 James corden is in it. Is this like the matrix lads.... Excuse me while I go to the bathroom to throw up chunks of wokeness that have been forced down my throat. omg, just make a movie with ""Cinderella\'s"" plot, call it something else and put whatever you like in it. Why.... why do you have to ruin classic? Or is it a parody? Why did Amazon cast that controversial person, which might affect their profit. Yet that’s why the other actors and actresses should shine. These people are just out of ideas. This is probably the 200,000th cinderella movie. Honestly here for Idina WTF ??! The magical woman ?? They literally tried to take the amazing Ella Enchanted and tried to ""put a twist on it"" to call it Cinderella. What a lazy attempt at remaking a beloved classic. no spoiler needed for this movie 💕 Not gonna lie, but tbh Shawn Mendes would make better prince Wait a minute, who are the mice / footmen??? You know everyone is gonna watch it only because the most famous British comedians (Corden, Ranganathan, Acaster) got these tiny roles??? Last time I saw a gay man as the fairy godmother in Cinderella it was in the 1977 adult film starring Rainbeaux Smith. 🖤 Two words:  Billy Porter!! Why they r making the same story again and again~ 😂 ♥️ Woke Cinderella. Wow........... Dude really you turned the fairy into a black dude. 😂 alright i kinda like the original by Disney and I can’t watch this because I feel\nIt will ruin my great childhood moments with Disney. gettin\' vanessa hudgen Vibes from her. Idk WHy? All for weirdos doing their thing, but for the love of all that is good, please write your own stories. For all of us who grew up with the wholesome fairy tales, we don\'t want you are selling. This movie looks so stupid, Disney+ is like, it\'s cool, Amazon Prime, you can have it. I’m more brown than this Chick and I opt for the next Mulan to be white 👍 The last Cinderella was far great than this one,, So Disney allows another classic to be ruined- what else is new? ""Why make billions when you could make millions"" When it will release? Cinderella getting the feminism treatment ....ugh What is the deal  with the Fairy Godmother they should call it Fairy God Brother SMH OMG  I said it once and I\'ll say it again this Movie is going to BLOW wait til we get some Lord of the woke Rings..coming soon from amazon. Really? We\'re doing this again? Okay then Is that the girl from Glee? ""even magic has its limit""\n\nWell, that\'s just lazy writing This is not a Cinderella movie, Cinderella is wearing a blue dress💙 💝 Disney has officially screwed the pooch. Romesh ranganathan and james acaster... this film is perfect G O O D 👍 So must everything be about gender and LGBTQ Oh, God, it\'s a PC Cinderella. \n\nROFL! Why do we need this, the last one was better Oh god, the fairy godmother is a dude!....well, I must see this movie now. What in the 🌎 is happening to society. The end is close!!!! Is this serious or parody? Disney would like to have a word with you , as soon as they are done with scarlet johanson Why another one? We already had cinderella story 😒 Mixed feeling on this one.. Well, at least the Prince didn\'t self  identify as a tree. Kids can\'t watch TV or movies without us explaining why the guy is wearing a dress!?🤬🤬🤬 1997 Brandi is my favourite CINDERELLA, and this 2021 movie is just sad tbt So woke! 🧡 Another classic movie destroyed with Hollywood wokeness.  🤦🏼\u200d♀️ First cruella now cinderella Why… that’s all I wanna know Though it looked good till a drag queen showed up thy recked it right there 01:54 is that James Corden?!?! What\'s this? Some bad dream? Yay! A new ""woke"" Cinderella movie. Jk don\'t care. CINDERELLA who is trying to build her startup This looks so terrible. I was excited when I saw a WOC as Cinderella... but wow. This looks awful. Cringy to say the least 🤮\nAnd No, I ain’t just talking about James Corden I’m obligated to hate this movie because. . . James Corden (and almost everything else about it)\n\n\nBut also. . . . . James Acaster is an underrated legend This movie has more ""woke"" in it than James Corden has cholesterol.  🤢 B O R I N G Just a reminder to everyone in the comments that the 1950 Disney movie is not, nor has it ever been the “original”. Lily James looks different I predict a flop too woke that original another classic story that does not resemble the classic story ... 💓 Bring back brandy No way the likes on this are real lmao Well, this looks ridiculous, dumb, and stupid. 😐 tell me why this trailer is the movie 💘 It has WOKE written all over it i watched the trailer with meethika💓❤😍 Tamar Braxton in it too? Some people might hate me for it, but i like nothing in this trailer, and it\'s extremely hard not to say that this all happened because of the ""PC"". Why isn\'t Cinderella white? (no, i\'m not a racist just because i point out that) Why is the fairy... a black man, who is dressed as a woman? \nWhy does the setting look like some kind of festival? I mean, everything looks total modern except their clothes... Seems lame way overly woke… it’ll flop, and rightfully so Not another Cinderella movie 🤦\u200d♂️ This was painful 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🧚\u200d♀️ Who are here from niharika\'s live 🔥 it\'s just sad.... Cinderell Dance Show it should be called I want to marry Only King Rowan. Nope. Big, giant, steaming NOPE.👎 Thank God this movie is not available for free. I\'ll never see it! The boy looks like ansuman from splitsvilla xi Okay wtf is wrong with the fairy god mother i swear to god someone pls take me back 2000 ! How many Cinderella movies does this make now, ? I\'ve lost count......... Fairy God-Mother? All clips u just seen in this trailer is the WHOLE MOVIE LMAO, well it\'s free IP, might as well milk it. You managed to ruin that too! What\'s the next? Nothing can top the last Disney live-action version of Cinderella with Lily James. This looks like a stupid reimagining to boost Cabellos singing career... Totally unnecessary. Common why the hell on earth do we need another cindrella movie. and to make it different why are you ruining the classic. Wow, this is gonna suck what...men fairygodmother....it something new actually Where can i watch it? Sha has a black man as her fairy GOD MOTHER not going to happen for me but actually not even before I saw that no musicals here thank you more over woke crap.....100 Twisted version of the original YASSSSSSS Billy Porter! What in the name of an abomination is this. There should be a limit to everything. Disastrous. Destroying our childhood. alternative title: Cinderella (parody version) Ah yes Cinderella in 2021, I wonder what woke stunt they will pull now. \nHardly a minute in and a gay black man with wearing god-knows-what appears. Venom! Is this a Parody? LOL I had to stop to see the traielr to not see the whole movie ( even knowing the end) 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Hmmmm..... this looks like an interesting interpretation of Cinderella.\n\nWow... Pierce Brosnan! Love him! Even I have my limits Ahora Cenicienta tiene una hadogaydrino 🤣😂 Camilla Cabella is in this movie? 😂😂😂😂😂😂 How dumb they keep making Cinderella film The next demi  lovato Oh....dear......God.......😨 The indoctrination and wokeness on this movie is over the top.... Stop changing children`s stories.... To finish this movie properly everyone there should be vegan and trans something gender Meh, that\'s about all I need to see. Another remake..boring! I was looking for Tom Kiffer from cindarella Please don\'t let James Corden ruin this They really didn\'t made a dude as a godmother 🙄🙄there goes all our good movies down the drain Is the situation that bad? Running from ideas of movies. Just remake asian movies. Cinderella\'s quite popular. Feminism feminism feminism......everywhere! Ok so they manage to find a new meaning for the word 💩 give it to me i am worth it Dear Hollywood. Stop. This is getting sad and depressing now. Stop. Trying to re-imagine classic movies from our childhood for quick money and shows the lack of originality and creativity you have left. Stop. Please stop. Please tell me this is a music video. Please I’m gonna go ahead and guess the same people that whine about appropriation are silent. Hypocrisy at its finest. Can they please just make like the princess and the frog movie Moulin Rouge meets Cinderella Hell na never playing this garbage at my house Here from the live of @ahsaassy ....❤❤❤ Wow I thought Cinderella is blonde? 🤦🏻\u200d♂️ ok bRUH I MUST WATCH THIS Camilla do your thing What the freak us this? \nNot Cinderella at all... also, is that elsa?

Locked Down,"['mepeWor5JPk', 'ecF50t2FHSA', 'CDQH0t6JiS4', 'vFq48QU5XjM', 'Q8m0oGSt9-8']","['Locked Down This looks like a lot of fun ! The trailer was really misleading from the start and became great at the end, really cool. I think it\'s nice to see movies use the pandemic as a backdrop for original stories and not only about the covid itself. It\'s now a huge part of our society and will change how we live for a long time, it\'s nice to see it being integrated and not ignored. Came in thinking it was a rom-com, came out realizing it was a heist thriller. Me innocently thinking that this would be a drama about a couple facing a marriage crisis during the pandemic 👁️👄👁️ i was expecting some type of ""marriage story"",  not a heist.. it looks great The movie was freakin’ great! They both give great performances and many lines are hilarious. Truly enjoyed it! Anne was stellar! That twist caught me by surprise and now I can\'t wait to watch it. This is Oscar worthy! Ann Hathaway deserves recognition for her spectacular performance, the improvisation, the brilliant character acting. Incredible I love the concept, I love the cast, and I cannot wait to see this movie! OK but this is exactly what I want out of a Covid era film, social commentary and heists, I love it! It was shot, probably, two months ago, now they already finished post-production and released the trailer. That was fast. I\'ve just finished watching this movie and it\'s great! 10/10 I love the idea,story and actors I\'m in high anticipation Great for the times we are living in !! WHO NEEDS A MOVIE ABOUT LOCKDOWN wait is that a heist movie?! While I think it\'s too early for COVID related films, since it\'s still happening, I\'m curious to see where this film goes and if it\'ll be good or not. Also the talent behind it is like a thousand times more talented than someone like Michael Bay so at least I have a little more faith than with Songbird. Glad to receive this movie from Doug Liman. Such wonderful director. ""Swingers"" and ""Go"" are beautiful indie films. I’m going to pretend this is a sequel to Ocean’s 8 and Anne is just recruiting Chiwetel into the crew. Not really into covid films while we are STILL fighting for it but i\'m probably watch it for Anne Hathaway 💅 It\'s amazing that Doug Liman can start this film a year after he finished \'Chaos Walking\' and still have it come out before it. This looks pretty good, I will most definitely be watching. Original content is what will keep streaming services alive. I’m looking forward to this Max original film! This actually looks like a solid heist movie! It\'s always delightful to watch Anne Hathway on screen I rarely hear Chiwetel use his British accent in most of his films. This looks good. I’m even more impressed that started filming this 4 months ago, wrapped 3 months ago. That was fast. Looks like a great escapist film! We need more films like this to show that we’re not alone in our struggles. And to have a little fun during this hell.😉 It has an interesting change of plot. I just watched this movie and it was great! The heist at the end was the best part What you expect: documentary about time during lockdown\nReality: crime heist around the lockdown situation Oh great a movie about the pandemic, who\'s coming out during our pandemic... The kind of story we need right now. This actually looks like so much fun!! Can’t wait for this movie 🎥 and it looks awesome Thank you all for supporting the film and writing good reviews. they had us in the first half, not gonna lie Looks good! I’ll definitely watch! SPOILERS: They won\'t get away with the steal, but they will learn that the real diamond was the bedrock of trust in their relationship :) Here\'s a theory:\nthey got two people to write the screenplay and all they were given was the title ""Locked Down."" One wrote about two lovers\' tragic-comedy tale of falling out during quarantine and the other wrote a heist movie. Producers thought, ""Why not both? 🤷🏻\u200d♂️"" and they ran with it, so here we are. Anne looks even more pretty after her pregnancy 😍 that was a twist I didn\'t see coming.....but hey I am down...Locked down ;) Finally, I’ve been waiting for a trailer Great movie.  Don\'t let the reviews fool you. Can\'t wait for this! Well, Never have I ever seen a plot twist like this in a trailer. Well played, count me in. Can\'t wait for that!!:) That took a turn real fast. I was rolling my eyes in the beginning like I have seen this before, another lockdown drama😂😂😂 I wish I was in Lockdown with Anne Hathaway. Watching from London. This looks interesting ❤️ I have to say, this looks rather interesting🤔\nGotta keep an eye on it. I dread the period after Covid, where all books, movies and shows will be about this... I’m actually looking forward to this We need this movie. We’ve had it coming. The only thing they’ll have to make sure of IS MAKE IT BELIEVABLE. Because we’ll know now.😆 \nStealing a diamond!? Ok, already failed, but we can’t say we all have t thought about it.😂👌🏼 love these two, i\'m game for this. Looks good - on my watch list. Living in the UK I’d like to watch this..... but I can’t because HBO Max isn’t available in the UK. ""One of the greatest titles in the world is parent, and one of the biggest blessings in the world is to have parents to call mom and dad.."" Let\'s go lockdown movies! I was waiting for the moment when art would start to be dominated by plots set during COVID and so it begins... Oh this is gonna be good. So much awesome talent. WOW that\'s what I call a twist in the story! So Covid got Gotham lockdown and Catwoman is still doing the same thing with the jewels... Looks interesting. Must have been written and shot quickly =) I jxt watched this its an incredible movie the acting was so good and natural If this movie had been released before the pandemic, it would be a Sci-Fi Post-Apocalyptic movie... What a world :) The cast 😍 dang i could have saved my relationship this year with just a diamond heist... why didnt i thinkof that We\'ll probably get a series of coronamovies, this one looks good, I\'ll definitely watch it loved it Was in the kitchen with my headphones on expecting this to be a rom-com, Then came the heist bit. I popped my head out of the kitchen door to see my monitor screen.  My Saturday just got interesting. perfeito Damn I feel like this movie is about me lol I feel like Paxton right now during pandemic lol 😂 i may be a little confused but i love it! And that\'s how trailers should be made. I thoroughly enjoyed this. Kind of didnt expect to. \nGot to see a bit of London town. Wait a minute. This is not what I thought it would be. I’m intrigued. ""You fired them well"" LMAO They had us going in the first half! This trailer is the living embodiment of the ""swerving bus"" meme This movie gives me so many ocean\'s 8 vibes.I can\'t belive Anne Hathaway and Mindy Kaling are in this movie, and also Anne Hathaway riding a bike while wearing a leather jacket that reminds me of Lou Miller(Cate Blanchett) in Ocean\'s 8 So a movie about 2020 right after its endgame eh? I dig it Thought this was dumb it got good good. Im feeling it HBO max should really get started with releasing some trailers for those 2021 movies Anne Hathaway being Selina Kyle again. I think I\'ll check this one out. The Edgar Allen Poe scene cracks me up! Lol How come HBO and WB are using perfect songs at perfect timings?\nSomething in the Way in The Batman and now here I am feeling Good by Michael Buble. She went from stealing jewelry to protecting 😂 This turned from  being about Lockdown to Anne Hathaway wanting to be a member of Oceans 8. 2 doug liman movies in one year, sweet! It is not an Ocean8, but it drew my attention because it is about today\'s pandemic conditions and it makes me smile as it includes comedy while watching.#annehathaway #LockedDown I find it impressive that this film was completed in two months.... I knew it, there will be a locked down movie Okay I have to admit I didn’t see that coming but it was a nice surprise. Can’t wait haha Anne Hathaway, queen of the heists. ""I would never accuse you of being happy and normal""\n\nlol :-) Warner Media needs to make HBO MAX available in international territories around everywhere. So that they can watch these kinds of movies and TV shows. Otherwise HBO MAX cannot compete with other streaming services. To bring more subscribers go international. I would watch this movie just for Ben Kingsley Looks great! Everyone ask HBO Max to give Firebreather a show with: #bringbackFirebreather I can\'t do it alone! We can do it if we all ask HBO Max every day until they make it happen!!! One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates♥️ The background score is peaceful We want that Snyder Cut trailer!!!! Anne being involved in a diamond theft again 🤣 Many movies coming. they seems budget is more but not still good.\nBut this one budget looks normal and trailer is good.\nThis is how to present.👌🏻 Anne Hathaway is such a goddess 😍 This looks great Imma watch it just for Anne Hathaway Well, that was unexpected. Not unliked. Just unexpected. Great movie 🎥 Just watched this movie.  Easily one of the more enjoyable movies I\'ve seen in a while.  The only reason it\'s got a low review is because there\'s a black man and a white woman in the movie and incels get triggered, so they review bombed the movie. The whole thing with people pulling down their masks to talk had better not go unremarked upon, or else I\'m going to end up hating these characters far too much to enjoy the film. When characters from Oceans 8 and 11 locked down together, expect another heist. Perfect 👌 HBO Max I cannot wait for you to launch in india. I love all of your content This trailer felt way beyond 3 minutes i work at harrods....the offered staff members to be extras...all the security guards are the actually guards as well as the workers lol....they filmed it during store close and early morning.\n\nIt was filmed when we came out the first lockdown during summer. I feel like it\'s a requirement that I do watch this movie at least for its name. Isn\'t Doug Limon directing also Chaos Walking? Damn, this man has a lot of job! This the kind of content that keeps me subscribed Anne is out there stealing diamonds again😂 definitely watching this Looks great Epic movie, marvellous acting best acting, quite funny , last month in France 2 peeps tried to steel a diamond 💎😀🤣 looks great just what I want to watch - people in zoom meetings - I do that all dang day Hope no one gets mad now and Anna has to apologize for it This felt like two different stories (ang genres) merged into one, and not in a good way. I hope I\'m wrong. Can we get the new version of feeling good?? Please HBO Max......🤔🤔💜💜 idk if im the only one, but if you are a psych fan then dule and jazmyn are in this!! If he could just use the power of dark dimension. Steven Knight wrote the script for Locke\nthen for Locked Down\nLet\'s guess the next:\nWill it be called Locked Downtown Well done for writing and shooting this all in the pandemic. I watching this trailer thinking “oh this looks like a nice lockdown rom com” and the music kicked in and I was like “wha” I’m really surprised that this looks that good Best movie i have ever watched. 😘❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😀😀😀😀😀😀❤❤❤❤❤ It\'s down right irresponsible for HBO to release a movie set during the pandemic with so many scenes of mask-less people.  I get that it\'s a movie and they want to see the actors faces, but this is effectively glamorizing not wearing a mask.  Shame. Daphne steals another diamond with the help of Amita. there is nothing i am less interested in than ""entertainment"" revolving around the pandemic Glad the first movie set in Covid just uses it as a backdrop as to doing a heist movie. Anne Hathaway is amazing The heist movie we need. Excited for this but I need you all to put some of your promotional weight behind Warrior can\'t wait. Anybody else find it odd that they made a movie about being locked down and social distancing but made it with an entire cast and crew filming in closed quarters and out in the streets and not actually following lock down orders like the rest of us? WHEN IS HBO MAX COMING TO THE UK!?!?!?!?? They have tried so hard to make this look like a thrilling action movie. What is it with trailers always having that bass bend? Grest Freedom Fry song ❤ From the director of Mr and Miss Smith, that is enough for me to watch this This looks more fun than Tenet tbh. They had us in the first half, ngl Only people who are completely incompetent at reading would think that it’s a twist that this turns into a heist movie Of course they had to set in the UK with American actors, not actually in the USA since America hardly went into a forced lock down because half of the nation and government still thinks it’s a hoax otherwise it’d be quite ironic This movie gives me so many ocean\'s 8 vibes . Starring: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anne Hathaway, Ben Kingsley, Ben Stiller, Stephen Merchant, Mindy Kaling, Dule Hill, and from director Doug Liman? That\'s a good crew! Surprised to see the director venture into R-rated territory. Queen Anne Hathaway forever! 👑🌟💖💖💎💖💖🌟 HBO, you should totally do a miniseries on the CCP, and how effective they were in containing the Coof You know, not to be a bleeding heart, but I find the whole atmosphere of this movie and trailer kinda inappropriate. \n\nPer the official statistics, globally 90 million people were infected by COVID, 2 million died, including numerous medical workers all over the world. Millions of people lost their jobs, who knows how many more will. Businesses were forced to close down, who knows how many more will. It seems to me that despite the fact the virus turned out not to be the World War Z lethal wipeout we kinda feared at the beginning of 2020, it\'s still an issue that by and large will lead only to negative results for many people.  Anne hathaway. My favorite actress No one is wearing masks in FTF situations! No wonder we have a British Invasion of a mutant Covid! I feel so bad for Anne Hathaway, ever since her Oscar win, she\'s been in countless BAD BAD BAD project with really shitty rotten tomato score. She needs to find her niche, fired her manager/ agent and be SUPER SELECTIVE with projects... Still don\'t understand how people can break down during the lockdown. I don\'t have much but I\'m happy every day and even in lockdown, I have great times messaging and calling my friends. I love myself and those around me. Never had a sad day So glad Anne isn’t doing an British accent 🤓 Film industry jumped on movies about lockdown pretty quickly. This is just twisted....a  movie set during the lockdown while we\'re still in the lockdown . this was suprisingly a good movie I’ve seen this ad pop up at least 10 times and didn’t even realize it was a movie trailer....Lmao For me to watch a movie about a lock down it’s to soon yet... but this... this is not a simple lockdown move... HBO Max is Awesome I’m here for this. What a pleasant surprise They fooled us with the beginning. But I mean this probably lost many viewers who thought it’s another fed up couple’s drama while stuck together during the quarantine lol We should watch it atleast for its name Low budget production, small scale story, high profile actors. This might be good. Show about lockdown in England awesome ... Just one tiny issue tho ... I\'m from England we are currently in lockdown but yet I can\'t get HBO max. I love Anne Hathaway😍 \'who would\'ve month ago we would be doing this\' \'Not me\' lmao I’m so confused how all these lockdown slash COVD movies are coming out and being made but small businesses are still shut down? I was like ""Anne H. will never star in a shitty movie""... And opps! this movie happens. Ok this is a very unexpected movie about the pandemic in a pandemic.😏😏 Another movie about Anne Hathaway plotting to pull off a jewelry heist? \n\nCount me in. Why does he have to be committing/complicit in a crime? 😩 I like both the actors and wanna give this a chance buuut😬 HBO Max is basically the best streaming service nobody wants to subscribe to. SMH. Netflix: Death of 2020\nHBO Max: Hold my beer I need the remix of Feeling Good used in this. This definitely did not go where I expected it to. Well, they chose the right city, nobody does lockdown (loooong) like London! :D :D :D A film that forgets about the heist part of their film til the last few minutes You just watched all the good parts HBO + CELEBS ... spend $$$ on a subject we’d rather forget. ....We all went through it .. Why would I pay HBO to watch something that was in 2020 & we’d rather be done with. STUPID Wow! Just wow!!!!!!!! 😱😋☺️ Freedom Fry- Shaky Ground is the song in the first portion of the trailer. Chiwetel Ejiofor is a good ass actor this trailer took a sharp left turn I was not expecting... Does anyone know the name of the music playing in the final motorcycle scene? I\'m still waiting to hear about edge of tomorrow 2 Nothing like making a movie aet during a pandemic to make me escape a pandemic Will be watching this. Anybody saw the movie and want to tell me if it\'s good or not? HBO Max give Firebreather a show!!! #bringbackFirebreather HBO Max give Firebreather a show!!! #bringbackFirebreather You know I hate covid-19 movies but this is cool Anne Hathaway stealing things is its own genre at this point HBO Max give Firebreather a show!!! #bringbackFirebreather You should watch ""together 2021"" if you want drama about couple facing a marriage crisis during the pandemic hbomax = the most epic streaming service on Earth. I\'m just here for Ben Stiller 🤭 For Hath Away, it\'s get smart PART 2 looks like a good time. Why did this trailer feel like an hour It\'s not about lockdown, but the effect of it. Looks like the script writers decided to add bit of lockdown masala to heist movie as an afterthought! Me: Oh God. Another interracial co-habitation story with the coronavirus lockdown as the setting. What the fuc...\n\nAlso Me: WAIT. A HEIST MOVIE?! TAKE MY BLOODY MONEY!!! Well now I have to watch it.. i thought it\'s a romantic dramedy and then it turned into a heist-film??? wow...that was unexpected...im IN This movie seems to take a weird turn lol Daphne Kluger stories after getting married 😂😂😂 Am I the only one missing the innocent Annie? She turned sassy these years...looked so intense and mean sometimes. Never seen a trailer go from smart to stupid so quickly I\'m anywhere Chinwetel and Anne is..💓 Brilliant movie, \nWow, Anne Hathaway is a Honey.\nI\'m not into love but... ""You had my curiosity, now you have my attention""... yes it was a heist movie,ben stiller is  in the movie thats why😂 Who here decided to Rob their Boss\'s Million dollar diamond during lockdown with their partner?\nAnne Hathaway: I did! This looks good Not that\'s what I call \'out of box\' thinking The trailer just went from north to south ⬇️ fast Looks interesting TRIPLE 9 + Cat Woman in a Lockdown  in Gotham!!! 💥 Omfg I been trying to find the trailer that used this song for the longest! I was an extra in this movie :D Who remixed this version of Feeling Good? Peace Breaker\n08:00 10:00 Does someone know which FEELING GOOD remix version used in this trailer ??? This seems a bit stupid and like the pandemic was just thrown in necessarily to relate to more people... What version of Feeling Good is playing in the Background? Westfield? In a movie? This is the most London movie ever. Edger Allen Poe! Back to 7th-grade literature class, we go. Para cuando hubo Max en Latinoamérica? Wow!! Refreshing!!! So Hollywood lacks any degree of creativity and imagination these days. it will be a part 2 with the variant virus lol Man when u put it this way it seems like we liv8ng in a movie ""Rachel Getting Married"", part II: Kym\'s 1st World, Self-Serving Wild-Ass Ways Continue... This is like making 9/11 into a romantic comedy. Have they no respect? Anne Hathaway is back as Catwoman apparently lockdown is already depressing why would i want to watch this Can anyone tell me the name of the song at the run away scene? Anne Hathaway plays a lot of jewel thieves and con artists\n+This \n+Batman \n+Ocean\'s 8 (But then she was a turncoat, not technically a thief at first) when is the movie coming out Trailer: The Whole Movie. Okay here is my thing about it though. Does it look like a good movie? Sure. But god why release it now? Just wait on it for a year or two so we can enjoy the memory of the shit show that is our lives right now but we can do so in the comfort of a movie theater surrounded by people who are not wearing masks. Instead when the credits are rolling we’ll just be like“ well that was fun” And then stare off deeply at a wall A low point in cinematic history No one would expect a story about a mixed race couple, huddling together like rats in a sardine can while corporate overlords rub their hands together.  Imagine my shock. Looking good HBO 😏... so, it is basically 12 friends of ocean, but with married couple and during lockdown?! PLOT TWIST! Anyone know the first song name in movie, nobody wants to leave alone 🎵.... plot twist: they both got covid at the end Ok, so who brainstormed about a wild stage name and came out with Edgar Allan Poe!!! Yeez.... Karl Mordo and Catwoman steal a diamond during lockdown? Sign me up! So, that\'s before she changed her name to Selina Kyle?\n\nWhen and where can I stream it in Germany? I am really exciting for that I think his italian voice fits better with the caracther Since the trailer gave away the entire plot  no need to see film. Only Hollywood would make a movie about first world problems during a world wide crisis. Watching !!! I\'ll be honest, this doesn\'t look good at all. Outside of Mandalorian and Better Call Saul, there just aren\'t very many good shows out there right now Well that didn\'t take long. Was wondering just how long it would take some douche to try and milt the pandemic Uhhh... it’s so frustrating that I can’t even watch it Anna Hathaway is Radhika Apte of HBO max 😂 Is it worth it?? Wow. THIS trailer How are they even filming anything right now?! We\'re in the middle of a pandemic... Of course the couple has to be interracial.  You notice how there slipping that into everything Thank existence that this is not a coronavirus lock in film. Phew. 🍷A HEIST DURIN A LOCKDOWN! ..  Seriously like who\'s FREAKIN\' BRILLIANT idea was that anyway? Ill wait for Dune what is the name of the Feeling Good remix on the trailer? I clicked this for Dulé Hill and wife Jazmyn Simon, they immediately disappeared and now so will I 🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣 Why didn\'t we here the voice of \'Merchant\' in the trailer? Karl probably didn\'t give him the message. #RESTORETHESYNDERVERSE When 2012 meets Ocean’s 8 Bring HBO MAX to Canada please 😭😭😭 Who remixed this version of Feeling Good? Faster than Michael Bay Ok what was the reason this middle class family needed to steal a diamond? I really do not know what is going on in this film. I just watched the whole movie HBO Max has made a pandemic heist movie well this took a turn The house they are staying in is probably worth 3 milli Soooo Ocean’s 8 lockdown edition Nah, I don\'t think it\'s going to be any good. This should have been titled Ocean’s 8: Daphe I only watch like 30 sec of trailers. If they can\'t convince me in that time then bye. And I don\'t want to see a whole movie in trailers Is this a prequel for Catwoman or something? Is this a sequel to Ocean\'s 8? .....did you guys accidentally combine two trailers? Ocean’s 8 sequel? 🤣 Is this Selina Kyle\'s origin story? 😎🤸\u200d♀️🔥 WE. DON’T. WANT. COVID. MOVIES. For some reason covid movies freak me out like why is this entertainment? This is  weird as fuck Welcome to the wave of Covid related films #RestoreTheSnyderVerse\n#ReleaseAyerCut I see Ocean\'s 8th got a spin off.. Clean slate The ultimate tool for a master thief with a record. C\'mon HBO, you are better than this so its not about the lockdown at all. Gotcha!!!!! i thought it was a film on marriage crisis well its a film about a diamond heist The simulated cam footage looks ridiculous. Pixelated like hell as if we live in the dial up age.  It looks stupid. Straight to DVD next to Black Panther movie. #Clever   !! Super gorgeous Anne Hathway💃😍 Downloading movies is virtuos. A movie about stealing during lockdown... 🤔 GOD 2021 ITS GOING TO BE EVEN WORST ISN´T IT? I really wanted to dislike this for being too woke and recent. However I couldn\'t help but like it. Why are revealing everything in the damn TRAILER!!!!!!!!! So inaccurate. The store had toilet paper nope not this movie it needed wayyyy too much patience Where is Ben Stiller? Cant find him in the trailer Where\'s the Snyder cut final trailer hbo max?😡 Is that the same man from dr strange? and this is how u normalize whats actually happening . cv19 is ahoax #BigLockdown Please bring back Infinity train!!! #BRING BACK INFINITY TRAIN #SAVEINFINITYTRAIN #INFINITYTRAINBOOK4 🙏🙏🙏 2:28 YASASS QUEEEN GOOOOO (my cousin is the one talking) Tasteless in so many different ways. So this is what Catwoman is doing now 🤔 I kind of like Anne Hathaway other star of Disney films and movies(PG Rated and G Rated)and cartoon and animated films I wish Disney plus can make Disney\'s The Princess Diaries 3⭐🌟🌠🌠🌟⭐🌠 Is this out yet how can I have like this Another COVID-19 Pandemic Movie 😷🦠 I\'m a huge fan of Doug Liman however this trailer makes me not really want to watch this movie... This trailer took a hard left Jazmyn Simon is so beautiful. She married her co worker Dule Hill. They both was on that show Ballers... Everybody is pretty much making YouTube movies now. I haven\'\'t seen something this insanely tone-deaf and out of touch since all those celebrities sang Imagine by john lennon. What a freakshow. it\'s good honstly I like to escape this coronavirus shit, without having to watch movies that feauture coronavirus as a plot Is it just me, or it seems like Hollywood is hyper-promoting this whole interracial thing... ""Listen. Blue birds fly with blue birds, red birds fly with red birds, pigeons wanna be with pigeons. I want my child to look like me, any intelligent person wants his child to look like him. I’m sad because I wanna blend out my race and lose my beautiful identity? Chinese love Chinese. Pakistanis love their culturue, Jewish people love their culture, you can take no Chinese man and give him a Puerto Rico woman, it’s nature to want to be with your own. I wanna be with my own."" Was that a Paul Rudd Hot Ones pun Oceans 11 then Oceans 8 and now Locked Down so... ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" pandemic edition -_- I just finished watching it so you don\'t have to ... Don\'t watch it . It sucks . Very random and dumb as hell movie . Only watched it because of Anne Hathaway, because she\'s a phenomenal actress nevertheless.\nBut this was a really weird and cringe movie .\nDon\'t waste your time . it is more like I watch Sartre\'s No Exit. who sing the song feeling good in this movie trailer HBO>Netflix nice work people And the name of the song is? Transformers the last knight tonight at 8/7c on USA 📕 only slightly less tasteless than whatever the hell Michael Bay was doing in u tube Indian trailers Indian promos r make million viewers in a day then y don\'t make Hollywood 0:18: “Shaky Ground” by Freedom Fry Where is this movie going? A bit sick making a movie about the pandemic makes me sick making a joke about it all Edgar Allan Poe :D If your an anti mask person this movie not for you Should’ve been some thriller instead of a blah story . More thriller less blah When you arrveing in India still HBO Max is not in India Distribuited by Warner Bros Pictures 2020 Still Selina Kyle’ing!? When they make trailer that shows complete plot and twist, you know it\'s a trash movie! Like that Terminator flick where in trailer we learn that John Connor is machine! xD I\'d watch this if it wasn\'t a ww with a bm. Too bad they have to force their agenda. Realistic 앤 이제 40이구나 So they have shows set in England but people in England can’t watch it That was quick😄 Where are all the masks!!!! This film took place at edmunds planet. What is the song ? Give this to Canadians 🙄🙄🙄 what\'s the first song This comment section is great lol Sorry, but where is the Ben Stiller? No thanks. I like escapism in my movies. 1:50\n1:54\n2:10 At least it\'s more realistic and not scare-mongering compared to whatever the hell Michael Bay is doing. Still taking advantage of a shitty and painful situation for money though Nice Funny.. We still on lock down.. Kinda Hi I\'m sory to bother you guys.  But here in Ontario Canada we have our YouTube  blocked,  we are in lockdown with 8pm curfew and not able to comment on our news videos. Please tell the Queen we need her help here Eh. I\'ll pass. Too soon. Locked down locked down ايش الإعلان الخرا ذا؟؟ مو المفروض يكون أفضل لقطات من الفلم؟؟ كيف كذا كله ممل؟؟ Devirsty let’s go 🔥 Sorry i dont want to rewind lockdown again Too soon they wearing masks in movies now? im done. don\'t bring Nina Simone into this pls COVID-19 + ocean eleven I was thinking his name Edgar allan poe like filipino actor 1:03 music name?? 0:20 song ? Release hbo max in England Cant stand Anne Hat away... Same old fucking generic story where they went like hey let\'s make it a heist movie but put it during the lockdown. I\'ll pass Feels like they wanted to make a romantic comedy but at the last moment changed script and filmed heist movie.\nAlso there is literally no chemistry between them... launch your services in Pakistan already Looks like a Zoom Call. Sorry, but it does. Looks like a bad movie imo Just watched this movie. Boy did it suck! So boring. For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,\n1 Corinthians 15:3-4  tragic just tragic. rubbish Wallowing in pandemic misery....we don\'t need your movie Max, we\'ve had enough. Where\'s my mortal kombat trailer Too soon… bro All of those of different languages how to you say the words fuck no please share with the world,  Do not make this the new normal Another money heist Call Of Heroes\n06:00 08:00 Bruh no one wants to see these COVID movies, trust me Cute WHERE IS BEN STILLEE all movies in the past year have been retarded John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen... Wow lol So nobody in London knows Edgar Allan Poe? The true fight its in you.Become a champion right now.walk with me for a moment.\nThis is truly the great awakakening and the great reset not mans attempt. Heres the good news rather than then heres the deal. Make america great only by making know King Jesus.Greatness comes by being a humble servant.God loves you  but you must believe and receive it and realise you done evil and are guilty of eternal punishment. However God saved you, loves so you dont have to go to hell. Recieve power health peace freedom ,a friendship with the Saviour Jesus comfort now and eternal life with Him. Man cant save you look to the one who already gave you everything.Your just blind to see it from pride and selfifishness becsuse of evil. Why does she live with her Uber driver? Piece of crap movie I like Chiwetel and usually don\'t hate Annie but this looks insufferable sorry Dule Hill? Me looking through the comments finding out this is about a heist 👁👄👁 Jesus wept 🤦\u200d♂️ Does she have to be a black lover? No thx A white woman with a black man. In every single f*cking movie. What is going on??? I hate post corona movie and series era where virus is mentioned. Never watching it. Makes me depressed.  For me movies is the only way escape  from this fucking situation What a joke Don’t normalize corona. Open the country.  All these movies suck nowadays lame. its always white woman black man Covid Cringe 😬 BORING Worst movie 🤮🤮🤮 Cheap shot movie. Not interested This movie isnt good  .. 45 min in and nothing is happening .. boring AF . Meh. No thanks The longest trailer in history. No need to watch this thing. Gross This seem in bad taste?? I don\'t care about some relationship-problems privileged rich people have during lockdown Worse movie ever What a great movie.  No white male lead.  Perfect.  Only flaw,  not enough gender fluid characters. boring 😀😁@ edgar allen poe!!\npaging: mr conan doyale..\nmr. doyale... Looks stupid. Don\'t bother. Not only we live in pandemic reality,media bombards us with this shit every day now they will feed us with that crap in the movies.No thanks....tired of this grey reality. 0:45 Emang ads meguri ya? its horrible guys,,don\'t waste your time cringe fest Lel Millions have died now Hollywood try to make money out of a movie about it Woke garbage Uggghhh hey umm what about Recently there are a LOT of series with mixed race couples..the streamers are really pushing it O f u Hmm Low key movies like this just seem boring and a time waster, like come out with another oceans 8 movie or something interesting not this 🤮 Racist! Oh yeah Hi!! The black guy should have been will Smith, he is more handsome Trashhh Pass At least it\'s not another pacifist song. Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures. \n\nIf you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior. Because let\'s assume a security officier is so uneducated that they have not heard of Edgar Allen Poe.... We want more Mexican/Latino Men in Lead roles not lame black cringey men b bike looks very bad another jewish actress with a black husband It needs to at least show white guys as being feminine, beta, marrying black women or evil. It\'s not subversive enough! Ah,yes,the black male white female couple strikes once again This lead actor is not looks like a hero I hate this. Why are Anne Hathaway only in garbage movies these days? Asking that question to that toilet paper guy  was  killingly funny I love the idea,story and actors I\'m in high anticipation Great for the times we are living in !! How did it go from surviving lockdown to a bank heist. Wow Looking forward to the movies has two of my favorite actors definitely gonna watch it Oh man o.k. I\'m watching this. I can\'t wait! i work at harrods....the offered staff members to be extras...all the security guards are the actually guards as well as the workers lol....they filmed it during store close and early morning.\n\nIt was filmed when we came out the first lockdown during summer. Actually looks like alot of fun I thought it was gonna be good until it turned into a heist movie  This looks good. I wish that  people would take mask wearing a little more seriously on TV... Check out the trailer for LOCKED DOWN starring Anne Hathaway and Lily James! A few problems I have with this movie. \nA: We don\'t need a movie exploiting a real and dangerous crisis currently crippling our nation. Wait til we conquer and get past it.  I mm going to know that powell takes his magical sound of violins I thought the wanted to save their marriage...what a twist  I\'m wearing my mask while watching this becuase doing anything, like watching a movie about the pendemic would not be complete without wearing a mask. ^_^ there is not one single good movie with hattaway...this is amazing I knew people will make a movie about the pandemic. lol at least it\'s not a horror genre. Perfect  Queen Anne Hathaway forever!  Only people who are completely incompetent at reading would think that it’s a twist that this turns into a heist movie A couple attempts a high-risk, high-stakes jewelry heist at a department store. Excellent! They\'re both incredible actors. And very sexy. now we humans know for sure how animals spend their lives in cage Who else was expecting a school lockdown to happen? So a movie made by the corporate elite, with corporate elite actors, about getting back at the corporate elite that took advantage of or only looked out for themselves during a pandemic.\n\nI mean it looks like it could be entertaining, but the premise comes off as hypocritical grandstanding when you consider these A list actors being backed by companies that most likely participated in what the movie critiques. Just doesn\'t quite sit right with me  I hear john powell is going to score the film Finally a movie with covid generation  I am a simple man I see Anne I click i thought is romantic movies but at the end they doing heist lol I love to watch Anne Hathaway Still not as bad as being really locked down in prison... You need to get a grip  Hi From Melbourne Australia, 210 days of lockdown and counting.  We will be lucky to be out by Xmas 2021. the way i thought we would see lucy boynton in the trailer- Aren\'t we on our second wave Lock Down? \n\n#Trailerrecuts So It has Began!  I feel like i watched the whole movie by watching this trailer A love story set in the time of covid..uhh fuck yes! It\'s Edgar Allen Poe for me. LOL. This one looks more like a \'feel good\' COVID film. Instead of the Songbird film. Really irresponsible. Stealing is bad \nThe film industry shouldn’t condone theft Another Covid Lockdown movie WTF !!!  Number 1 rule : Don\'t ever say "" What could go wrong"" 2020: the movie Wow they made a movie about it...wait a minute. Seriously not even a year after the lockdown happened they’re releasing a movie about it. And what’s worse is that it’s an action movie in action movie/spy movie about a traumatic event in world history that causes millions of deaths millions of relationships to end millions of people separated the millions of people people are wondering what her life ever go back to normal. And they’re making an action movie of it. Hollywood has truly hit a new low. Why am I being a critic like this ""Listen. Blue birds fly with blue birds, red birds fly with red birds, pigeons wanna be with pigeons. I want my child to look like me, any intelligent person wants his child to look like him. I’m sad because I wanna blend out my race and lose my beautiful identity? Chinese love Chinese. Pakistanis love their culturue, Jewish people love their culture, you can take no Chinese man and give him a Puerto Rico woman, it’s nature to want to be with your own. I wanna be with my own."" When your pandemic is such a joke you a make a movie about it. Now we are watching people in quarantine. We are too board!!! I immediately recognized him as the Actor of “12 years a Slave” ! But this movie here looks like a total waste of his qualities tbh… not worth watching imo. ""Edgar Allan Poe\'s LOCKED DOWN"" starring Edgar Allan Poe So in real life they all did not locked down. I just read Lockdown  I actually thought the movie is about the virus Why does this seem so familiar? IT\'S COVID ORIGINAL, NOT HBO MAX ORIGINAL. fun thing you can count how many bug are there in house and even rats This mov  also using covid as bg ... is better than  tht covid Songbird.  Like he did in the bourne identity mr and mrs smith jumper LUCY BOYNTON SO TRUE This movie disturbs me Ah yes, the BMWF combo, what a surprise Thats what i said from the director of mr and mrs smith First like and first comment ️️️ Wow this was a major stinker!

More IR propaganda lol. Thanks Hollywood локдаун фильм 2021 Chiwetel not looking so good...     better watch your back brother. Lazy film making. Easy way to make a quick buck with minimum effort.

The Woman in the Window,"['v_0GJg_Jnlo', 'J0hTmzISOlQ', '2nXlpd8uq-M', 'MJk4CITQ6a4', 'XXWZrvCITB4']","['The Woman in the Window This woman deserves an Oscar...she is so underrated.. remember enchanted,,her pose and her grace in that movie was angelic.... I have been waiting for this forever! Can\'t wait!🍿 Finally I\'ve been waiting for this movie since the pandemic year No matter how many movies I\'ve seen about \'Is she crazy or did it all really happen?\', I still love these kind of movies. Amy is one of the best actresses of our age. She nailes every single role. This is the kind of movie I want to see alone and not see alone at the same time. Netflix was waiting for a Pandemic, they had a whole folder titled backup incase of a pandemic Amy Adams Adapted All Acting Roles... One of the best performer in Hollywood After Sharp Objects I\'ve been waiting like anything for Amy Adams back in a psychological thriller... I\'m just in love with her acting ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💖💖💖💖💖💖💖 Interesting to see how much attention this movie grabs being released on Netflix compared to its original theatrical release. Lot of people won’t realize this movie had a trailer release before the pandemic and wasn’t a Netflix title Finally a dark thriller that looks promising! Strong Gone Girl and Sharp Objects vibes. Been waiting for this movie since 2019. Amy Adams can really adapt to any character effortlessly and I\'m really amazed by the way they set the trailer. It gave little hints without disclosing the real shit show that is the climax. So excited for this!! The way this movie was supposed to come out in theaters in 2019... I\'ve read the book. I already know what happens. BUT STILL, this trailer had me on the edge of my seat. Can\'t wait to watch this! Amy is an incredible actress. One of the best of her generation. The cinematography in this movie was phenomenal! She really did deserve an Oscar. My goodness Amy Adams never fails to delight us with her brilliance! She was so effing good in the movie as if she was really suffering from agoraphobia. Loved her, loved the twist! People shitting on this movie can sit tf down. Omg i cant believe this movie is gonna to be in Netflix Honestly i\'d give it a 7.5/10, it\'s a pretty decent film with a great performance from Amy Adams and the cinematography looks gorgeous 😍 I binged this book at the beginning of the pandemic. So excited this movie is finally coming out This looks way better than what the original trailer had promised. Glad it\'s being released on Netflix. After reading the book, this trailer looks like they really stuck to the main plot points! The house looks a lot like I imagined it. Finally...This movie has been on my ""to watch"" list since December 2019... I only recognized Gary Oldman after his fourth scene. That man can shapeshift. This woman\'s life is so relatable, except I do go out for groceries once a month and I\'d never let anyone into my house. \nIt\'s a peaceful existence Poor Lois looks completely lost after Clark\'s death.\nOn a serious note this looks really promising. Can’t wait !\nI loved the book and the movie looks amazeballs! Looks like a pretty good psychological thriller and I’m always in when I see Jennifer Jason Leigh she’s a great actress also Amy Adams is a phenom actress and I absolutely adore Julianne Moore Please give her Oscar! 💜 I love psychological thrillers. This is why I’m a psychology major!! That looks awesome. Can’t wait . She’s an amazing actress! Is it finally being released I’ve been waiting forever This looks amazing! Can\'t wait.  What an exceptional cast! Let\'s hope to god this isn\'t going to be another dissapointment. Because I\'m so excited for this! Me tooooo! So glad I read the book! If I didn’t, I’d be in shock! At least I know what to expect! The cast is great too! This is the most awaited movie for many of us! Looks like a motion picture that I would probably enjoy watching. Great cast, exciting enough story. Thanks Netflix. Amy was enough for me to tune in. Then Julianne shows up and I was thrilled. The whole cast is outstanding. That Amy can act! Its a winner Netflix 🔥🙌🏻🙌🏻 I remember seeing the first trailer for this in the theater back in 2019. So glad Disney sold it to Netflix (it was originally a 20th Century Studios film) and it’s finally getting released.\n\nAnd I just learned Danny Elfman did the score for this! Hell yes!!!! Don´t worry, this trailer didn´t spoil anything. There are a million twists in the book. Having not read the book I thought the movie was great. Exceptional acting all round (Amy was amazing), great prod values and wonderful score. Yes the premise has been done similarly before but this is a modern take on the genre. Being compared to Hitchcock can\'t be bad right?! Very underrated on Imdb and I think it\'s worth at least a 7.5. I read this book a year ago and I was SUPER excited to watch this. The cast was absolutely amazing. But the movie definitely didn\'t do the book justice. It\'s obviously extremely difficult to adapt. The best part of the book was the way it made the reader question everything. To the point where the reader couldn\'t even trust the protagonist anymore. The movie was okay but it definitely could\'ve been written 10 times better. Hoping this movie turns out as amazing as the book! No matter a book or a revised updated movie from the past there are always good points and a new way of interpreting the writer\'s original intent.  The actors are of highest calibre as well as the supporting actors.  The murdered showed us what he could do - I don\'t recall seeing him in anything before.    You cannot deny their acting skills.  The movie was technically very good, the suspenseful moments were quite acceptable.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and will not put a negative comment about it because I choose to see it\'s own merit.  Thanks. This book is my fav I really hope the movie does justice to it 💛 Finally! I’ve been waiting for this movie to be released! If the movie is going to be at least half as good as the book\nThen it\'s definitely worth watching. I’m so excited, I read the book and loved it 😍 Through any character at this woman and she\'ll nail the role..That\'s how good she is! Finally I\'ve been waiting like crazy for this to come!Good thing I finished the book already. This movie was absolutely amazing anyone who hasn\'t watched it watch it you will be amazed Giving me major flight plan feels.That movie was amazing too! Been waiting to see this for a long time now. Excited to finally watch it on Netflix! :) FINALLY. I saw the original trailer for this in 2019 and I\'ve been patiently waiting. I hope the movie is worth it. Just give Amy Adams the Oscars already Looks like a pretty good adaptation of the book. Cant wait! After seeing the trailer, I feel like the book has finally come to life. Finally!!! I\'ve been waiting for this movie for over a year now! I wasin\'t expecting someone like Oldamn to show up.\nOne of the greatest of this generation! SOME ONE GIVE AMY HER OSCAR!!!! This performance looks oscar worthy tho Those who have read the book know it\'ll be hard to mess up the adaptation, even more so when u cast Amy Adams, Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman! The book is a 4.5/5 for me Finally!! So excited to watch it!! Loved the book. Read the book and LOVED it. Can\'t wait for the movie. I love movies like this. . gives different vibes, not horror but gives you chills all over and makes you fidgety after watching  😂 am I wierd or what?  😌😂😂 Just finished the book! It was so good 🙊 i\'m gonna watch this tomorrow I have waited so long for this.... It really has felt like 84 years i saw so many mixed reviews about this book and so i was kinda reluctant to read but it was actually so worth it, I can\'t wait to see the movie Read the book and am anxious to see the movie as I love Amy Adams! Give Amy Adams the Oscar she deserves!!!! They HAVE to give her a much overdue Oscar for this one! Looks like a mix of ""Rear Window"" and ""Sightless"". Looks good to me, definitely going to watch ☺️ This was literally the best book I\'ve ever read. Book was incredible! Been waiting on the movie for over a year! Here come another Oscar nomination for her, if not win. Hope she does this time. ❤️❤️ My goodness. I\'m in love with the movie already GIVE AMY AN OSCAR ALREADY! I looooved the movie. It made me question everything. The twist at the end was unexpected but at the same time it made sense. Amy Adams, Jessica Chastain and Bryce Dallas Howard desperately need to play sisters in a comedy! The movie was really cool, like those \n 90s house thrillers.\nGary Oldman Nailed It. I have been waiting for this movie since I first watched the trailer. I read the book and it was awesome and I still can\'t wait to watch it😁 I read the book and it was great, can’t wait for this movie 😃🤩 Read the book a wee while ago, so have been really looking forward to watching the movie! Anyone know, when it will be released on Netflix UK? Amy better win an Oscar this time!!! One of the best novels I have ever read...and now it\'s a movie...waiting for this one Lois Lane still hasn\'t recovered after Clark\'s death has she? Hopefully he makes sure she gets better. YEEEEES! IM SO GLAD THE MOVIE IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING!!!! Finally, a release date. Been waiting for this ever since it was announced i just finished the book and it was incredible. i hope the movie doesn\'t disappoint cuz im really lookin forward to it lol I want to see Amy Adams winning the Oscar. Loved the book, read it 2yrs ago... And thought ""this would make a great movie if done right"".... We shall see, finally. This was a good movie. Very unpredictable, lot\'s of plot twists. I loved the book so much my anticipation for this film is very high. i\'ve read the novel over and over, can\'t wait for the movie ^^ One of the best living actresses. AMY ADAMS ❤️❤️❤️ I love her so it cant even be described ❤️ An oscar for Amy, please... It hasn’t been five years but it FEELS LIKE five years since I first saw a trailer for this movie 💀 This is definitely my type of movie. 😍 So we have updated version of Rear Window.  Gary Oldman and Amy Adams, I bet no one is complaining This is Oscar worthy 👏 . Believe it or not Just 15 seconds and i got Goosebumps. Really loved the book 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾 Hope the film holds up🤞🏾 The book is so good. I hope this does it justice. I read the book recently. A little predictible but well-paced and good overall. I know Amy Adams will do an awesome job protraying the main character. Seriously,I\'ve been waiting Way to long for this! Just give Amy that Oscar! finally, i’ve been waiting this moment for so long🥺💜 The book was awesome right up to the end... hope the movie does it justice So the most awaited movie of the year is here!!! 🙌🔥 Gary Oldman is everywhere, what an actor! Just finished watching this on netflix moments ago, and it\'s a good one. Entertaining, a must watch! Oh yes 2 of my favorite actresses. \nIt looks very good and the trailer didnt give too much away . Congrats to the director of the photography on this. Netflix give this guy some money for other movies to film! And I\'m not even gonna start talking about the actors...what a cast! Amy Adams is brilliant ❤️ great movie 💙 old school ❤️ Finally another good movie to sedate the masses. more please. cant wait for this one...i read the book...amazing..hope the movie is going to be as good. Would have loved to watch this in Cinema with others. I miss the cinemas Having read the book, watching this trailer felt like I’ve watched all the movie. So excited to watch \nThe Woman In The Window on Netflix this May! Wow this trailer is so much better than the previous one from Fox. Oh my god, believe it or not this is how most likely I pictured it in my mind when I\'m reading the book itself! I\'m so excited! Amy Adams is an oscar-worthy performer. That\'s it. That\'s the post. The book was amazing can\'t wait I really liked the book so I hope they do it justice Sad to see this one ended up on Netflix, it deserved a theatrical release After minor editing problems, weird pre screening response and the closure of the Fox 2000 label, it was only recently Netflix acquired the rights for this film and finally, the world is going to see this. Can\'t wait for all of you to see this on May. This has been delayed TWO TIMES already so I think it\'s about time. Just finished the book about 5 minutes ago... I’m so excited to watch this 😩😩😣😣🙌🏼 I\'ve never been more excited to see a film in my While life..this is the Film I need to see.. I swear Woooow!!!!!! I’ve never waited for a movie THAT long Amy Adams is one of the best actress from her generation. Great loved it ❤️ Amy Adams was amazing in Sharp Objects. Hope she delivers in this one also.

I feel like I’ve been waiting for this movie for ages And the Oscar goes to Amy Adams for The Woman in The Window. My wife was lucky enough to see this trailer right before it dropped during a special Netflix Zoom call with the cast! Giving me same vibes as shutter island. \nI look forward to watching it! FINALLY!!!! one of my favourite novel❤️ The novel was unreadable but this looks great. Awesome cast. Can\'t wait to watch this! I have seen this concept in many films, but what will make me watch the movie is the ""the director from darkest hour and atonement"" It\'s obviously inspired from Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock. I\'m definitely gonna watch it! this is a great movie with a great cast amy adams is great in this movie This actually looks good let me double check...yep, it’s a Netflix movie impressive! Oscar winning performance by amy adams Been waiting for this since I read the book!! Amy Adams and Julianne Moore. Been waiting for this. Hollywood\'s A-list actresses. It\'s finally here, I\'ve been waiting for so long Just finished this book. Can\'t wait to see this on Netflix! Just saw it, very tense, mysterious and suspicious. The ending was surprising but still I would it like to be more convincingly and deeper. The book was really good and can\'t wait for this Looks good can’t wait to watch this !!! I AM SO GEARED UP FOR THIS FILM!!! The book was excellent and I hope the movie matches it. Damn they stay making Amy Adams look like death in a lot of her movies/shows. It ain’t right but she is phenomenal. After Sharp Objects I’m very excited for this! I read the book the women in the window it\'s a amazing thrilling story...There is a twist at the last...Wait and watch.. Omg that is the most amazing trailer i have ever seen😲😲😲. I am getting goose bumps for 2.10 minute straight Ive been waiting for 2 years for this i hope you dont disappoint us no more Keep \'em coming Netflix! somebody please give this woman an Oscar. Amy Adams~ this woman never ceases to amaze you Amy missed Oscar this year. Hopefully next year she will get a nod for this at least. GO, AMY!!!!!!! 💪 I couldn\'t wait for this any longer so I decided to buy the novel and read it instead. wow! what a plot twist! has anyone here read the novel too? The way I know this movie because of baking and a mystery makes me soo happy Was so looking forward to this and then the pandemic happened. Way to go Netflix for getting this title! :) What an amazing performance by Amy.... I thought they already forget to show this movie, because I\'ve been waiting for too long to watch this and finally they\'re gonna show it on May Please god give Amy Adams an Oscar for this This movie started off sooooo good but I didn’t like the ending honestly I was thinking it was going to lead to sum else but it was completely the opposite.. it was still pretty good I suppose Have been waiting for this forever... finally watched it and I\'m disappointed 💔 not what I expected Just watched this movie!\nToo good! I really enjoyed the book and hope that the movie is a good adaptation of it! Yessss , Finally , after a year waiting ❤😍🙌🏼 just finished reading the book.🔥🔥🔥 Finally!!! Been waiting to see this since I finished the book! May 15th can’t get here fast enough! Anthony Mackie\'s agent: Which movie do you want to be in? \nAnthony Mackie: Yes. I have read the book. I can\'t wait to watch it the adaptation! I was so ready to this in the theaters :( I wish it was coming out in theaters 😔 Amy Adams is an acting Queen!!! Oh finally movie is coming out, I have read the book few years ago and sadly I still remember the plot🤪😭😂 I hope this gives Amy her long overdue Oscar Yes I’ve been waiting on this movie since last year! 00:38 The tenderness itself. I love her. Terrific and what a cast.  Amy Adams is a brilliant actress. This cast... I’m speechless. Amy Adams is my absolute favorite <3 Everyone knows it\'s based on the book, it\'s been almost 3 years coming, so many already now know the so called ""surprise"" ending.. 👀 When I tell you I have been waiting for this forever 😭😭😭 I kinda hope the ending leaves us with more questions than answers. Those are my kind of films. I\'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE!!!! I\'ve been waiting for this movie😍 Okay.. Time to renew my Netflix subscription. Amy Adams can make me do anything. Ive been waiting for this too. Excited for this. YES the movies on netflix now!!!😍😍 Am I the only one or actually, this movie makes absolute sense during the time of pandemic? 🙈 Contrarily to my habits, which are not to expect anything when choosing a movie to watch, this one I had expectations.\n\nBecause of liking Amy Adams in her other movies, I was expecting to be intrigued & captivated by the story.\n\n\n\nAt 15:00m, Julianne Moore shows up & I did not like that part, even though it lasted 5-6 minutes. Felt like an eternity! I was so excited for this movie after I loved the novel but this was kind of disappointing.. the plot twists weren\'t well executed and most of the important key parts of the novel were completely excluded. this could have been so much better This movie IS SO GOOD! FINALLY! I kept checking to see when this was coming out! I\'ve have been waiting for this movie since 1 year even though i read the book ive been waiting for this to come out on netflix I always think that this whole situation could\'ve been avoided with simply taking a picture, either a selfie with the wife or of the murder on the other side, I mean were all attached to our phones, first thing to do in any situation is get evidence and cameras don\'t lie. yessss netflix....they have been pumping out content!! THIS IS WHAT I PAID FOR I’m trying to finish the book so vigorously!! Looks good, can\'t wait ! Heart Pounding! Netflix chose the perfect TIME to release this film- and i have been an ardent follower of Amy Adams\'s films....6 times nominated in Oscar without a win.....lets see if the board now appreciates her talent.....when i have Gary Oldman and her in the same film......nobody should dare to make a bad comment I loved Hitchcock\'s ""Rear Window"" with Jimmy Stewart. Looking forward to this remake. As an agoraphobe, I have no idea why people keep picturing us as watching the outside world with binoculars. You can have the outside world. I want nothing whatsoever to do with it. Stella cast. I CAN\'T wait!! Amy possibly finally getting her Oscar! The camera positioning moment @1:31 awesome The first trailer felt like gone girl and this trailer feels like Knives Out which just shows the impact of that movie! AT LAST!!!! THIS WILL BE IN NETFLIX!!! WAITING FOR THIS SINCE LAST YEAR!!!!! It\'s like the classic movie ""Rear Window"" starring Jimmy Stewart. The book is brilliant 🎥🎥 ""I can’t go outside."" Sounds relevant. I have been waiting for this movie for so long 😭😭😭 This is a great book so Im hoping for a great film This movie has a strong Alfred Hitchcock vibe :) A bloody good novel. Read it! I mean, this looks EXACTLY like the books. I forget how it ends though I remember watching this when I was a kid.  It was called Rear Window back then. Amy Adams has been fighting for an Oscar long time ago. Amy adams ...she rocks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Ive beeeeen waiting for this movie, i cant wait!!!!!! it\'s time for amy adams to get another oscar best actress nom and maybe her first win unbelivably good movie 10/10 would recommend .... and the triler is NOT spoilling....amazed Just watched it yesterday. It\'s ok. Lots of cliche and you won\'t feel sorry when it\'s finished but it\'s alright. Урааа фильм вышел !!!!!!  Я очень долго его ждала Been waiting a whole damn year for this shit to come out! About time! Thank you Netflix! Watch on Netflix.....very good acting and really interesting story......must watch👍 This trailer is everything!!! Very reminiscent of Rear Window.  I can’t wait to see this. After Clark died Lois has not been the same. Sending positive vibes your way Lois. Hmmmm well it looks decent I’ll give it a shot, haven’t seen a psychological thriller in awhile This an honest question, why do some people hated it? I mean i watched it and thought is was really good. This actually seems really good coming from someone who hates horror movies I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE! A twist on ""The Rear Window"".  Can\'t wait to see it. CAN AMY ADAMS WIN A DAMN OSCAR ALREADY LIKEEEE DAAAAMN Amy Adams gives us amazing movies Okay, as excited as I am for this movie, did Netflix have to wait for a global pandemic with us being stuck in our homes to release this. I\'m so excited for this. It\'s directed by Joe Wright who made atonement so yay more reasons to be excited! I adore Amy Adams!!! she is the best. Saw Arrival some time back. She is Amazing I was waiting for this since so long😍😍❤❤ I have been looking forward to this movie ...I love these thriller movies excited to see if it compares to hone girl Looks like a twist on the Hitchcock “bedroom window” movie Been waiting for this for a long time. Finally a date!! This trailer has been floating around for well over a year! It will be one of the best psychological thriller after Gone Girl \n. Read this book by same name.  It was great.  Good twist ending. Reminds me of Hitchcock’s Rear Window - this movie is going to be spectacular Amy Adams\nJulianne Moore\nGary Oldman I have been waiting for this movie! If you’re even feeling stupid, just remember that the academy hasn’t given Amy an Oscar yet I hope this is as good as it deserves to be THIS IS GOING TO BE EPIC Rear Window\'s one of my favorite movies. Been waiting for this movie the minute it was announced 2017 or 2018 Idk. The delays and shit..... and when I found out that Netflix was in interested in it I was happy cause we’ll finally get it! Can’t wait. And this ladies and gentlemen is how amy adams finally get oscar win Soo disappointing 😞 especially I\'ve been anticipating it for so long and it turns out to be horrendous. Can\'t believe all these A list actors participated in this, actually embarrassed for them 😒 A modern gothic type story and film. I enjoyed it. One of my favorite bet in Best Actress for the Oscars 2022 Can’t wait almost here 😀 wow this actually looks great! Best movie this Spring 10 out of 10. Just watch. It\'s like Disturbia + Unknown + Flightplan combine with Nocturnal Animals. Nice. I\'ll watch anything with amy adams in it. BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!! I love this book This movie is perfect for Netflix, during this pandemic, home movies marathon will always be number 1 to do finally this movie is being released.  Got backlogged for way too long. So Sam Wilson and John Walker are in a film together now 😂 I hope its as good as the book, because the book was bomb! Watched this and I\'m going to be honest, I was kinda disappointed. The whole film felt rushed and messy. Wish there were more scenes between Anna and David, cause their scenes were refreshing. I think this film would have worked better as a mini series than this. Nice! This is like a modern day version of Hitchcock\'s Rear Window. I\'ve watched something like this in a Hindi movie, same concept! God I loved it! Recently there was another movie from the same concept which was the actress from Riverdale. But I can\'t remember the story. Similar concepts! love it ! Won’t lie at first I was like boooooooo! But the scenes that followed right after she seen the girl get shot. Had my face deep in my phone. Omg I’ve been waiting for ever for this!!! Waiting for this since 2019! I just finished reading the book and AH I SEE ALL THE MAIN PARTS HERE Pengambilan gambar yg sangat indah hanya di satu set lokasi. Seharusnya film seperti ini di tonton di bioskop 👏 Finally!!! I\'ve been waiting too long Bruh why didn’t I hear about all these movies🙄there are so many on Netflix I didn’t know about😭I think I should start watchin☺️ I’m afraid if panini will not end , I might be like Amy Adams  😂 gonna read the book now I\'ve read the book and it\'s good Gosh so this is what happened to Giselle when she decided to stay in the real world. Thanks Netflix , I\'m so happy that you\'re saved this movie ! great cast great trailer. can\'t wait... Done watch it, and I’m so happy ❤️ good adaptation Hope the Academy gives Amy the trophy i am so excited for this ""you have never met my wife""\nAhh Shit here we go again Buenísima! I believe this is what happened to Martha.. “its been so long since we’ve seen that smile on your face” Amy Adams coming for her Oscars!! This actually looks very promising Wow this looks an amazing movie.. Triller.. Drama.. Slasher as well. Action. I really need movies like this 😍🔥\nWhere can i watch this movie except netflex..? Gary Oldman is considered to be a favorite for the Oscars. Mank is a great film to win. finally netflix... something good for while... I wonder who can relate to someone having to stay home Amazing cast! This was so good! I need to quickly read the book before this releases Gary Oldman is for sure a chameleon! This performance is giving me Leon movie Gary Oldman vibes!! amy adams never acts in and movies and this looks so promising. im excited !! SO THIS IS REAR WINDOW, VIEW OF TERROR, THE NEIGHBOR IN THE WINDOW, THE NEIGHBOR, THE GOOD NEIGHBOR, DISTURBIA, Men At Work, Peeping Tom & THE TENANT ALL ROLLED UP INTO ONE I read this excellent book and was very surprised! My whole thinking is who is gonna watch something with a story like this after the last year? 😂 Going to watch this movie because of Amy Adams Omg, two of my favourite actresses!! For the first time in my reading life, I think the movie may just be better then the book... IVE BEEN WAITINF FOR THIS MOBIE FOR SO LONGGG Looks incredible! 💥 This is the first thing I am gonna do after my finals end Finally!!! The subscription next month is gonna be worthed The trailer lets out everything about the movie! OMG this is so scared and dark trailer i have ever scene. I m gonna watch this!! thanks for making amazing material. that monologue before the flashback was funny for me and the detective telling her her family was dead like we didn’t know but it’s kinda decent im upset that the reflection of katie was in the wineglass and not the window!!!!!! it was so genius in the book that she was in the window because the title could refer to anna but also ""jane"" in that picture. When will the stupidity of driving and turning the head to the co-driver or looking for a mobile phone that dropped on the car floor, end? It\'s becoming ridiculous and degrades our intelligence. Enough with this silliness. I stopped the movie when the car crashed. This looks effing great! FINAALLLYYYY BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG 😭😭😭 THIS IS SUCH A COOL MOVIE!! YOU WILL NOT WASTE TIME WATCHIN IT! A Netflix Film? I could have sworn I saw trailers for this movie a year or two ago and totally forgot about it, thought that it may have come out and I am now just remembering that I wanted to see it. Whose film was this originally? Looking forward to watching this now finally, thank you Netflix if this movie its the half the book its going to be great i was so excited for this movie ... biggest let down Just what we need - another superhero movie ... huh, what?! Old school thriller, yeaah! I read the book. Really good. 10/10 superb\n trailer!! Oh shit \nI’ve been waiting for this movie for so long best movie ive ever seen released first on netflix. flawless. That’s cool 👍🏼😊 No matter how many films Julianne Moore is in, I\'ll never be able to see her without hearing the JP theme This seems a lot like Rear Window Oh sh!t I can\'t wait for this one. Hopefully this will win Amy\'s Oscar... and its fun to see Lois with Captain America & Falcon 😂 Excellent.\n\nA real movie in the age if special effect garbage. This gives off A24 vibe. I dig it That\'s my film sorted tnyt been waiting for this for ages and great cast too 👌 It\'s like ""The Girl On The Train"" meets ""Columbus Circle"" Book was okay. But I figured out the killer and when it was revealed later I was like “ugh I knew it.” \n\nIt’s really REALLY obvious who the killer is. Worth your time. Amy adams did it again. YUP I CAN’T WAIT FOR THIS Finally this has been postponed bc of covid happy to see Netflix finally releasing Read the book and now the movie 🙏🔥🔥🔥❤️ I have to say I love Amy and Moore and I love these kind of thriller movies... but this one was boring and lived only for the aesthetics. Storytelling was so rushed and jumpy, but that’s imo It was so trippy ! Loved it. Wyatt Russell is also in this one (John Walker, the new cap America)\ngreat actor ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Finally ,it\'s coming after 1 and half years Ive been waiting for this movie sooo long, why do you let me suffer another hole month? D: Really2 good movie. Dont trust IMDB ratings. This is a good one. Worth the watch. Fox: This was mine movie tho.\nNetflix: Yeah but not it\'s mine. The book was decently enjoyable. I liked it. Though a bit dragged. But it seemed perfect for a movie adaptation. Just watched the movie, before the trailer. Pretty ballsy showing that death scene The book is so good. 🤔 Anthony Mackie? Must\'ve missed him. Looks like a great psych thriller though! Great Cast! I\'ve been waiting for this movie This looks really good! Why so hard for Oscar to give Amy that award It’s giving “The Wolf Hour” plot if you know you know. Oscar deserves Amy Adamas, Queen Now this is mind bending!!! I was really anticipated this movie since its very first trailer, i think around 2019. But after watching this on netflix, it felt that somehow rush. The casts were spectacular but the execution was underwhelming for me. It was fine but not gripping. Maybe I just had big expectation. Looks  Amazing !!! This movie finna be GOOD!!😭😭😭 38 minutes in, and my love for Amy Adams is not enough to have to endure the rest of this boring ass, dumb movie.  I was psyched too! I\'m happy I forgot about the trailer lol. Now I watch it again, I see they gave away pretty much everything! x) Great cast, incredible tension-building, lame ass twist ending. Third act felt like a completely different movie. The Woman In The Window (2021) Amy Adams as Dr. Anna. Also in the cast are Gary Oldman, Anthony Mackie, Fred Hechinger, Wyatt Russell, Brian Tyree Henry, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Julianne Moore in their supporting roles. Read the book, I hope this is just as good. Amy Adams going all in for Oscar moral of the story: don\'t cheat I am on my way to complete the novel and they already decided to release it as a movie? Damn, am I slow or am I slow? وكالعادة الوحيد اللي جاي يشوف تريلر الفيلم بعد فيديو خلف زون 😂😄❤ I can\'t wait too see this, looks awesome.  Also I see Anthony Mackie is listed in the credits but I didn\'t notice him in this trailer...? This book was good!! I just hope the move adaptation isn\'t any different I so love her omg! Amy Adams Oh man I just watched Bram Stoker\'s Dracula the other day on Netflix 💖 it\'s good to see Gary Oldman again. Interesting white hair. Pretty sure this was supposed to be a movie? glad it was finally released anyway! This movie broke the record for a black dude dying in a movie.... this dude died before it even started lmfao 🤣...... brah I\'m dying 😭 This film had two failed test screenings, allegedly. Both the original and recut version. I think it looks good, to be honest! Yessss I’ve been waiting for soooo long This is Amy\'s Oscar!!! I read the novel, which was pretty good, and was hugely anticipating the film on Netflix. So I watched it, and was very disappointed because it was too ""noisy"" and distracting, while the book was stealthy, and built up slowly, creepily, over time. Of course, since the film is fairly short, it had to be speeded up, I guess. But the worse thing is: they changed the ending! In the book, the ending was actually very satisfying, but in the film they made it crazy and, frankly, annoying. Love the cast, but c\'est la vie. Interested to know if anyone else here felt the same way. this sucks compared to how i imagined it in my head after reading the book😂 Just finished the book and now, time to judge the movie adaptation! oh boy Looks fantastic I’ll give it a go Looks completely different from the other trailer (namely the coloring contrast), but I\'ll definitely still watch it. I need so much of the score of this trailer She\'s really learning to go outside her box then this happened to her. What a life! I read the book, gotta watch the movie. dreaming of the day when I will be able to read comments and see the video at the same time lol The suspense is really good tho. I read the book a couple of months ago and I just finished watching the movie. If you see my comment please go grab the book and read it. The movie is completely dissapointing. Come thru Brian Tyree Henry 🙌🏾 🙌🏾🙌🏾 This better be as good as the book. Very good movie 👍🏼👍🏼 Spoiler alert!\n.\n.\n. This trailer already scared the shit out of me. But Amy Adams is gold. Amy Adams: ""... I.. can\'t go outside"" \n- Look, we can\'t either Mkay? ... damn this trailer is intense. I got scared there for a bit. hopefully the movie is just like that. I really got jodie foster flightplan vibes here. Looking forward too it. also where can i find the music o.o As great as this looks, I’m more excited to see Trixie and Katya react to it...🤣 In the middle of this book right now!!!!!!! It’s insane Omg 😱 \nThis movie was 5 stars! \n⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ Yo ya ví el libro buenísimo me lo eche de una sentada jiji¡¡¡¡ The cat is a shapeshifter, calling it now. A little touch of ""Rear Window"" with Jimmy Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock, maybe? No, no! Totally inspired!!! This looks insane! Read the book. Its pretty good! I felt like I’ve already seen this movie, and then I remembered Stephanie Soo talked about this book in one of her videos. lol 😂 the whole movie in 2 minutes and 30 sec. 🔥 I think the people saying this movie is good are just upset that they wasted their time on this shit ass snooze fest and so now want other people to as well. I would see this for Gary since he looks an Oldman now! Pandemic happened and now Netflix could able to take over movies from other Production houses It\'s cool, \nIt looks like Fractured, I love plot twist THANK U! I have been waiting for this forever! omg why\'d yall have to wait 2 years to release it though😂 Looks intriguing \n\nThanks the trailer didn\'t spoil the film What? No wonder I familiar with this trailer. And this coming to Netflix?! NICE!! I\'m here to see John Walker playing mysteries character. 1:28 1:46 2:04 At first I thought it was just like the secret window. It might be inspired in it, but it seems there\'s more. I bet this will be a great movie THIS MOVIE IS FUCKN AMAZING\nMYST WATCH 💯 It\'s got a feel similar to Rear Window. Looks good, but shall I read the book first before this comes out? lol مين جاي من عند خلف 😂👍 This looks really good and I think they are all gaslighting her. There\'s going to be some serious twists in this movie I feel. I\'m gonna get on my Netflix this weekend. Between having a Shudder account and Netflix, sometimes it\'s hard on which site I want to go to. After seeing Julianne Moore is in this, when I just watched Magnolia again and seeing Jennifer Jason Leigh in The Hateful Eight and now she\'s in this, I\'m sold. listened to a podcast rundown of this book like a year ago, saw this, and i immediately knew this was it- Finally 🙌 This is so exciting She is shuch a good actress ♥️😘 من جاي من عند خلف ؟😂 FODA  DEMAISSSSSSSSSSSSS I stopped watching after the racist comment about the family across the street being ""too white"". Seeing a car with snow coming down on top of it in your room is normal. I have like two of those in my room. yess been waiting for this! When you run out of names for movies—- they need to make an sequel “ the man in the window “ I love how Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train and The Woman in the window all have cats in it I feel like this went from theatres to netflix Terrible movie. Don’t waste your time. Seen this trailer for 2+ years now. Hope it\'s a good mystery. Alfred Hitchcock would have LOVED this! This trailer gave me the CHILLLLZZZZ!!!!!!😤😣😣😖😖 Y’all took forever I swear. I have been waiting for this for 2 yrs YES!!! FINALLYY!! More trash from Netflix PLEASE PLEASE give Amy Adams an Oscar PLEASEEEE Damn, Finally I have been waiting for this too long. Best thriller 😁 Alfred Hitchcock Rear Window vibes, love the clear inspiration I already feel like I have seen this 15 times Don\'t believe the critics. The movie is great Can\'t wait..This film is Long long overdue..This is probably the most exciting film since the titanic in my opinion This movie sucked. Sorry, not sorry. Such a great underrated actress... Thank you netflix! Now, it\'s time to buy A quiet place 2 and Antlers! Picked this book from a train station bookstore. Now am watching it\'s trailer. The trailer shows so much of the plot I feel like I\'ve already watched the movie. When does this come out? Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you\'ll be ecstatic with the decision you made today. Wow this looks really good My two lovely ladies. And Gary Oldman. With the awesome Joe Wright. Can’t wait. I was once had a hallucinations and i thought i was crazy, i saw things and i heard voices, and i hated when people told me that it\'s not REAL!!! For my birthday,  well played Netflix. Two plot twists in this movie. You should read the book. 🙂 Most likely a decent adaptation with a very good cast but hey, it\'s just a trailer. you all sound so confident.. I\'ll take your words for it.. I hope you didn\'t all let me down.. <3 thanks for the reviews I’d watch this. Good date night movie Julianne is still so freaking gorgeous Why am I obsessed with girls and women? First The Girl On The Train and then this This feels like Rear Window, but more expanded. This looks good!!! Behold, the greatest Amy Adams! For everyone getting way too excited, be a bit cautious. This went through a lot of reshoots and was recieved very poorly with test audiences. Looks so interesting Am I the only one or does it look really similar to ""The Girl on the Train""? Oh yeah this looks great!!! Looks really good but the reviews are not so favourable. Makes me want to watch it even more. I\'m sure Captain America will have this all straightened out in no time It\'s  Lois, she\'s the key! im sure i saw this trailer like a year or two years ago and i was just thinking about it yesterday and i found it here Not familiar with source material, but this clip has ""Rear Window reboot"" vibes all day This might be really good but the trailer shows way too much. Keep some excitement for the film. this is pretty much a modern version of  the 1954 Rear Window by Legendary director Alfred Hitchcock And when are you going to do a documentary on the drama around the publication of the novel? now THIS is the kind of movie I would like to work in!!\n\n \nwhich is not possible :/ Netflix do be dropping a lot of trailers hoping stranger things 4 is next or soon 😌 very good movie .nice plot It may have a low rating on rotten tomatoes but I liked it. This is gonna be lit. Can\'t wait to watch the ""confusing ending"" the original filmmakers were so worried about us not understanding. Reminds me of the movie Copycat with Sigourney Weaver. I\'ve been isolating since March 2020, and the only thing I fear about going outside is being hurt by ""peaceful protesters"". I\'m one of the very few people on this planet that hated the book, but I still plan on watching this movie.  Too much talent to pass on it.  Really cool to see Paper Boi, too. omg!!!!! when does this come out Looks really good Isn\'t this like the 3rd trailer?\nIt\'s such a simple story, I\'m scared they\'re revealing every plot point and detail... To those of you saying this makes sense due to the pandemic, or whatever else you keep saying. Her condition don\'t have anything to do with the coronavirus. It is a real fear, that some people have, and have been around for years. Going outside and what not give them high levels of anxiety. She mention the word for it in this trailer, but it don\'t have anything to do with coronavirus or the pandemic. Smh. The Lois Lane we needed! This was supposed to be released in 2019 which means they prob filmed it in like 2017 AND got delayed by the pandemic so thats about 4 years she waited for this movie to come out thats a whole ass high school experience! The number of Falcon and the Winter Soldier puns in this movie is crazy if you can catch em\'😂 The way Americans say agoraphobic is low key hilarious 😂 Can\'t wait now What if... it\'s like The Game and it\'s all just therapy? I sense some \'Disturbia\' feels in this movie. ""The film was originally scheduled to be released theatrically in 2019, but was delayed due to re-editing after test screenings. Theatrical release was later canceled due to the COVID and it was sold to Netflix.""\n\nYeah...as much as I like Amy Adams. This description doesn\'t look like it\'s gonna be a good one. Hope I am proven wrong though! That\'s what lois went through when Clark wasn\'t there Such a let down. The actresses were awesome, the music was really good aswell, you could kinda like the old school takes, but the plot was so banal. So disappointed. The other trailer was better in my\nopinion, but I’m glad Netflix is releasing it. Due to the pandemic I just read the book. I wonder if they’ll add some twists? Ahhh the wonderful twist like dream house and the movie 23. 🤔🧐 I’d watch this I would watch informotials of just amy adams talking about which toilet paper is better for hours Ooh love this I love Amy Adams. Hopefully this is as good as her other film... Not that crap annoying hillbilly crap. Plus love julianne Moore, Jennifer Jason leigh,.... Reminds me of rear window Fred Hechinger KILLED this this looks like a good one It was so freakin good Well it\'s seem to be a good tribute to Rear Window by Hitchcock Jennifer Jason Leigh\nAmy Adams \nJulianne Moore Nothing can excites me more than the witcher second season. Knew the son was evil from the get go lol That was Goodooo!! Did this get a release in any country?  Or did Netflix buy it for all countries? Well the only really good thing l loved about the movie was the house, it was \nbeautiful. Movie was about a 6/10. This is how it REEEALLY was for Lois Lane during the time superman had died!(LOL)🤣🤣🤣🤣 Finally!!!!!!! AMY ADAMS COMING FOR THE OSCARS YAS QUEEN Waoo just waoo❤️ and my favourite Julian ❤️ Well, I feel like I\'ve watched the movie already... what is it with trailers these days? They should be half as long She is always Lois Lane. Having aliens and crimes in her radar. But Clark can\'t save her this time cause he is nailed by Doomsday. Outstanding. Well that’s one way of using psychological warfare on the common viewer to be more closed and less communicative with their neighbours. Bro Anthony is in everything 😂 There was a sinhala movie called “Janelaya” same meaning to window in 1987 Srilanka Is anyone else other than myself going to mention how that camera lens is not even remotely long enough to be able to spy on other people\'s houses? I really enjoyed the book, therefor I had high expectations for the movie. Very disappointed, they could have added more scenes, everything seemed so rushed. For everyone saying this trailer gives away too much, don\'t worry, there\'s a million twists in the book! I’ll watch anything this woman is in from sharp objects to this novel. She is nailing psychological thriller This book gave me CHILLS ... flawless writing. I cannot wait to see this movie, but for those of you who haven\'t read the book yet, believe me, you should. Amy Adams gives a mind blowing performance \nOscars : Lets snub her again Saw the trailer. Just finished the book. This will be so good. Was getting worried about this film after they decided to delay it to redo parts but it honesty looks incredible. Cannot wait to see it. The book is absolutely amazing. I just hope that the movie does justice to it. Love that Amy is playing more challenging and nuanced roles that showcase her ability as an artist. We love to see it. Truly she needs an Oscar !! Amy Adams is such a marvelous actress. I just finished watching this movie on Netflix (finally, cause I\'ve been waiting like forever to watch this) and I actually thought it was really good! Amy Adams is definitely one of my favorite actresses, so I was glad to watch it cause she\'s in it! I don\'t really get why people are giving it a bad review, but hey not everyone has to like this movie ..... I mean there are movies out there that I don\'t really care for either, but this movie was definitely not a bad movie to me at all, I mean it definitely gave the thriller vibe;especially towards the last few minutes of the movie! P.S - I have heard that this movie is based on the book but I definitely perfer to watch the movie instead of reading the book but I know that might just be me and that\'s okay. I know not everyone is going to like the movie better then the book. There she goes, Amy Adams giving us another breathtaking performance, I hope that with this she gets all the attention she deserves, such an amazing actress! If this movie doesn’t land her an Oscar. We riot. At one point during the book, I felt like I had been punched in the stomach. I cried for about an hour. There is one twist that is utterly shattering... I hope they do it justice in the film, as it’s so beautifully narrated in the book. God I love Amy Adams. Even her small roles like night in the museum to the big ones like this. Somebody give her the award she deserves! Ok so having just finished the book I am VERY excited for this! They have such a great cast together it\'s blowing my mind. I fully can see Anna in Amy Adams! Also, knowing what I know, they did the book justice by the edits of this trailer. I can\'t wait to watch this! we all know Amy will never fail to amaze us. I\'m not a fan of homicides or anything that involves with blood, but this is interesting. Honestly i\'d give it a 7.5/10, it\'s a pretty decent film with a great performance from Amy Adams and the cinematography looks gorgeous  Gosh Julianne Moore doesn\'t age. She  must be a  vampire. She deserves more than an Oscar, she should be the next Marilyn Monroe or better. Amy must get Oscar this time, the trailer itself shows how dedicated she is  It’s always interesting to see movies inspired by Rear Window. Gives you a lot to think about - that what happens at home is considered to be “private” but how private is it really? Excited for this!  This is giving me rear window vibes and I’m here for it. Give Amy an Oscar already! Masterpiece  Amy Adams is a genius, she\'s brilliant ️ JUSTICE FOR AMY ADAMS THIS WOMAN DESERVES AN ACADEMY AWARD Amy adams needs an Oscar already. She needs recognition for her contribution to cinema. Younger actors have got an Oscar for less. Amy Adams: breathes\nMe: And give this woman her Oscar, god dammit Gary Oldman is a practically a piece of art in each movie, he\'s so talented and brilliant, all his movies are very good realized. I just finished the book! I want to see this movie SOOOOO BAD. Amy Adams is going to absolutely kill it The cinematography in this movie was phenomenal! Could someone PLEASE give this woman a god-damned Oscar?! Just watch it and i think she deserves an Oscar for his role \nThe movie is so freaking good 10/10 and don\'t worry you will be shocked at the end. PLEASE DON\'T RUIN IT! \nThis book was so beautifully written and what a twist at the end\nI\'m so glad that Amy is in it I just finished reading the book after seeing this trailer a few days ago. It\'s very well-written, a classic case of whodunit but still manages to mess with your mind and spark excitement. If you liked Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train, I recommend reading this one too! Amy is a freaking solid actress I\'m reading the book right now. They absolutely NAILED the casting. Especially Amy Adams. \nCannot wait I freaking loved reading \'The Woman in the Window\' and to see it being adapted by one of my favourite actresses, I\'m extremely overwhelmed !!!!!!! I\'ve read this book and it\'s got one heck of a twisted plot. Amy Adams doesn\'t disappoint. It\'s exactly what I envisioned the character. I love amy adams and I want to see her with an oscar now! She\'s pure talent We can all agree that the music to this trailer is pretty good. My question is \nHow can someone afford all that house without going out of house for work Bought the book yesterday. Finished it the same evening. Wow! What a read...Absolutely incredible! Heartbreaking! Lots of twists and turns. If you haven\'t read it yet, GO! NOW!!!! Let’s just take a second to appreciate how good Brian Tyree Henry will be even though he wasn’t given much screen time in the trailer Just finished the book, the trailer looks EXTREMELY loyal to it, I’m so happy because the book is absolutely 10/10 I watched the movie. It\'s absolutely worth your time. The suspense remains till the end. I LOVED the book, with all it’s movie references, and I can’t wait for the movie version. ️ Amy is so versatile  she always bring different kind of movies to us...and off course her performance here will be ignored by the academy once again! This is not just a movie, it\'s a masterpiece!!! \n\nAmy Adams acting deserves much of an award!! U cannot see whats gonna happen. Wow just wow I have already read the novel and it was amazing. Looking forward for the movie with great expectations. Just finished reading the book. Absolutely incredible, with so many twists. \n\n\nI really hope this movie doesn\'t chop it up and ruin it. Loved the book and Amy Adams is a great casting choice for the lead. Can’t wait to see this!!! Definitely worth watching especially after reading the actual novel. I\'m excited! This looks awesome. Great cast, stunning visuals and the story seems absolutely thrilling. I dont usually watch movies based on actors, but Amy Adams almost never agrees to play in bad movies. So I\'ll definitely be seeing this. I love Amy Adams, she\'s a magnificent actress and all her movies are wonderful. I can\'t wait to see this. Man, reading the book made me feel like I was watching a movie, I hope this will not fail my expectations.  Can\'t wait It\'s been such a long time since I\'ve seen a trailer and wanted to watch the movie. This looks like a good quality movie compared to all the crap Hollywood churns out these days. I miss a good story like the movies 10 to 20 years ago used to tell. This looks good! I’m 3/4 done with the book and it’s amazinggg. I can’t put it down. I know books are always better than the movie but this trailer looks like it won’t disappoint. Sharp Objects and now this...\nJust give her an Oscar right away!!! Amy adams deserves the world. She is absolutely a terrific actress! I read the book , and the trailer seems to be quite on point, hope the movie too is good Does anyone know when this will finally be released on demand or DVD? This movie looks so good. Honestly, I’m super surprised at how good this looks. After reading the book, I was worried about it becoming boring as a film due to the near “one location” only setting. Hope they changed the ending. Amy Adams, without trying at all and no makeup is still GORGEOUS. This was so well developed and what a castI’m so excited  if I would be honest the trailer is much better than the actual thing Amy Adams needs an Oscar. I\'ve read the book and its amazing. The trailer seems fine, I hope they do justice to the book and its mindblowing plot twist. This book was amazing I’m so excited for the movie  almost finished with the book! yesterday i read the MAJOR plot twist, now i\'m super excited to see my baby amy in this!!!!!!! can\'t believe it hasn\'t come sooner This is my absolute favorite book! I can’t wait to see how the movie is. I am so inlove with the book, and I’m excited to see the movie... I just wish they didn’t change the story that much ️ If Amy Adams involves in it, It\'s gonna a be an instant classic. She\'s back by popular demand. I’m almost done reading the book. This motivates me to finish reading it. I can’t wait to watch it. The book is soooo good. Everyone should def read it before watching the movie :) Amy adams will win Oscar one day just like Mr Dicaprio I finished reading the book Last night and it was amazing. OMG, I wanted to scream.  Next month: The Girl on the  Train Looking Out The Window at the Woman on the Grass. Amy Adams just amazing. Whenever i saw her on screen she mesmerized me with her acting skill Just finished the book! So happy to see Amy Adams in this role! I can\'t wait to see it AMY ADAMS DESERVES AN OSCAR. PERIOD. GIVE HER A F*****G OSCAR!  Amy adams never failed my expectations. I have watched her on nocturnal animals, leap year, arrival, etc. and dang, such a dramatic and massive personality shifts from one character to another. I have been turning on notification for the Netflix release. Thank god AJ Finn wanted Amy in the role and she took on the challenge. After reading the book I can’t wait to see how it plays out on screen! This book gave me chills reading. Can’t wait to watch the movie  I just finished this book. Awesome. Saw the trailer. Now I can\'t wait for it to be released. I\'ve read the book the year it was produced and it was the best lecture of my life!\nHighly recommend it, especially if you\'re waiting for the movie. Books always have more details, as it is the primary source. \nCan\'t believe Gary Oldman will play Alistair Russel. Amazing!\nWaiting for the movie, while reading the book for the 2nd time. Thank you, A.J. Finn! Comment section\n90% : Amy Adams is back\n10% : give Oscar to Amy Adams Was already planning to watch but seeing Jennifer Jason Leigh sealed it. Love that woman! AMY ADAMS STANS UNITE WE\'RE GONNA GET HER AN OSCAR NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES Loved the book! So excited to see this! This looks amazing Amy Adams is such a good actress everyone should watch Sharp Objects!! I loved this book! I\'m excited to see the film adaptation Give Amy the Oscar already! Amy is the greatest actress.\nHer acting in nocturnal animal is amazing. One of the finest actor womens Leonardo..\nShe deserve oscar I am excited for this! I just finished the book last month and found out today that it will be a movie!! And the movie looks promisiiiiiiinggggggg!! Oh my Goooooooood!!!!\n\n6 more months of waiting. *SPOILERS*\n\n\nI love these types of movies where the one person knows something\'s up but nobody believes them, and then you\'re like gradually starting to believe them less and less too as an audience, only to find out it was all true. I love it, it\'s so good THAT MUSE SOUNDTRACK HITS DIFFERENT  People are really quick to judge her but omg i got blown how she has incorporated this role in herself. If this movie does not give her the Oscars, i dunno anymore. When that song kicked in at the start...... ""I have lived in darkness...."" sent chiiiils down my spine.... That\'s how you do it  I like the ending because it wasn\'t predictable, but it was one of those endings that\'s right under your nose. You just gotta look closely. RELEASE  THIS ALREADY,WE BEEN WAITING SO LONG I made sure i finished the book before they put it on Netflix. Loved it! Can’t wait. Loved this movie 10/10 This movie is a mixture of Rear Window, The Girl On The Train, Gone Girl, Vertigo, Shutter Island, Disturbia, Copycat, Side Effects, Panic Room, Columbus Circle, The Lady Vanishes, Arlington Road, Amnesia, Witness To Murder, Nocturnal Animals, Unknown, Secret Window, The Others, Hush, Flightplan, Widows & A Simple Favor and I hope it\'s just as good as most of those movies. Amy is finally getting the Oscar she deserves Do y’all think she’ll get the Oscar with this one?? She really deserves like she’s been nominated 6 times ( maybe 7 with hillbilly elegy ) but they snubbed she’s also been snubbed many times. Arrival, Big eyes ,  nocturnal animals and ... WHEN IS THIS MOVIE COMING OUT OH MY GOD Omg I love this woman can\'t wait to watch it looks amazing ️ I can\'t wait for this movie.  The book is absolutely brilliant . If there’s Amy Adams, you know this is quality material Can you please give Amy her Oscar now?  OMG!! I just finished reading the novel a couple of weeks ago, the characters are as I pictured except for the husbandwl whom I  thought would be younger This trailer is doing a perfect job protecting the authenticity of the book. Nothing\'s revealed. You have to watch till the end to know what actually happens. i appreciate that they make movies about agoraphobia. This one looks amazing, will show a lot of strength. But I would like one feel good, maybe realistic romance movie about us. Always with the thrillers and creepy stuff. Bro I can’t wait to see this! I literally cried for no reason towards the end for basically no reason  ""911...I think there\'s someone in my house."" \n\nWe hear these lines every now and then in thrillers. Oscar winning performance like always. Amy Adams. When she saw that lady falling backwards it was so creepy I got chills! Someone please give this woman an Oscar already God, I\'m so happy Amy Adams is in this. She slayed her role in ""Sharp Objects"" im almost done with the book and i cannot wait to watch the movie!!! i love amy I finished the book in three days! Can\'t wait to see it! Read the book and it was so good! Super excited for the movie! And the oscar for best actress goes to , "" Amy Adams!!!"" Her acting skills are mind blowing  This trailer alone deserves an Oscar You know It’s a good movie when Amy Adams is casted in it I do love Amy Adams and I’m definitely watching! Simple. I see Amy and Juliane in the trailer.... i will definately go watch it in the cinemas. Amy Adams!!  I’m going to watch it in cinema once it’s released.. because Amy is in it!! Will Amy win an Oscar finally?? After getting robbed for so many times.. Geez I\'ve been waiting for so long for this to come out already! Looks so good, hope they are done pushing back the date. The book is amazing! I can’t wait to see the movie! Ahhh !! I’m so excited lol This movie I honestly felt had so much potential I just thought it was all over the place This book was killer. Looking forward to seeing this. This trailer giving me goosebumps ️ My top 3 horror dramas:\nWoman in the window\nWoman in black\nand then  Wow!!! I think it\'s time for Amy to grab an Oscar with this one!!!! Is anyone else getting “the girl on the train” vibes ? I just finished the book. I’m pumped for this! Great cinematography, great acting I read the book! It’s super good! Can’t wait to see this! I\'ve read this book and it\'s awesome!! also the rooftop scene is exactly what I imagine it to be!!\n\nalso the real Jane Russell had dark hair.\nand that\'s gonna cost you lost of faith people!! Just finished the book. It was slow but amazing I can’t get over it.. IT WAS AMAZING This reminds me of the Emily Blunt movie about the woman on the train. I just read this book it’s great the ending has a good twist I love seeing Pam from The Office doing all these other roles, so cool ! watching this right after i watched missmangobutt retelling the novel. all the details like the earrings, the hammer gave me goosebumps. im still amazed how she could remember all that. I love the book,i love the trailer and i know i will love this movie. Joe Wright is very talented director. Amy is such an incredible person  A psychological suspense thriller with the elegant direction of Joe Wright and protagonized by the talented Amy Adams. Wow.\n\nThis is going to be great. I can\'t wait for the rooftop scene. Just finished the books, and my mind can\'t rest right now.  That was amazing story. This will be a hard movie to make after reading he book, but Amy Adams and Joe Wright can hopefully pull it off! Amy is the GOAT After reading the frustrating but wonderful book, I hope Amy Adams gives a great performance just like in the book. Somebody please give her an Oscar for God\'s sake. Having read the book, this gives me chills. AMY ADAMS\nGARY OLDMAN\nJULIANE MOORE incredible cast wtf Well, thank god I read the book. Can’t wait to see the movie. This is why you don’t let anyone in. Ever. This movie trailer makes me want to really read the book! I can\'t wait to read the , then see the ! I liked Knives Out: I have a feeling The Woman in the Window will have a similar vibe. Someone give this woman her Oscar already I have just finished reading the book and omg its so good there are a bunch of twists and honestly its just so good. i read the book and love that they picked amy adams for this! i am super excited! Can\'t wait for this to come out glad it\'s on Netflix Amy Adams: breathes\nme: presents her an oscar I think  it’s a great idea to show something like this because there’s so many people who suffer from mental health problems like myself and don’t know who to talk to about this kind of thing sadly but maybe doing a movie will finally help people understand some of the things we go through Hopefully I have panic attack’s ptsd psychosis etc & can’t explain how it effects me to people who don’t have these problems KAZ 🇬🇧  I bought the novel immediately after I watched this trailer. The novel is really awsome and I can’t wait to watch the movie I loved this book so much and I was picturing Amy Adams or Michelle Williams for the lead character. Cannot wait to see this! This trailer is enough to win the Oscar  Amy is absolutely amazing! The novel was a best seller IM SCHOCKED to see no one has read it. LIKE IF U HAVE PLS Looks amazing. Also has \'Rear Window\' vibe to it. Can\'t wait. I just completed the book!! \nNow I\'m gonna watch the movie.\nNetflix, I\'m coming Done watching and this film is very powerful in a deeper sense. Highly recommended. I\'ve read the book and I\'m really excited for this. It\'s definitely inspired by Hitchcock. Think Rear Window meets Vertigo meets The Lady Vanishes... A similar feel to Gone Girl and The Girl on The Train. Just finished the book today! Ahh can’t wait for this ""From the studio that brought you Gone Girl"" - Speaking of which, how awesome would this movie be if it was directed by David Fincher though... This book was amazing despite the AJ Finn cancer scandal. Excited to see the movie. After all, who doesnt love Amy Adams. I’m gonna take my Latin aunts to this movie, to see if they stop being the gossipers they are  Well, I\'ve read the book.\nAnd I know Amy would be perfect to portray Dr. Anna Fox I\'m so worried how the movie will turned out to be because at first they delayed it due to poor test screenings in which the movie had reshoots mostly for the ending. But based on this trailer, finger crossed, it\'s gonna be good!!! Amy Adams is amazing in this movie. I really liked the movie. Notice how DC always casts the best actors/actresses in all their films, Ben Afflecks upcoming film, Henry Cavill in Witcher, Christian Bale in Ford and Amy Adams in this, truly talented! She was absolutely AMAZING in Sharp Objects and The Fighter (loved her accent there) Remember when she was selling purses in the office? Her breakup with Jim really took a toll on her. \n\n\nKidding aside this was a great book! The classic unreliable narrator with a few twists. Hope it would be a great adaptation! Are they going to ignore the subplot of her husband and child?  I loved that part of the story! It made my heart ache for the character and her struggle! I feel like this movie looks good. This seems sorta like one of my favorite mystery movies of all time Rear Window but on steroids... I dig it Started reading the book and im loving it but i so cant wait for the movie to come out This Movie looks really good can’t wait to see it! I JUST FINISHED READING THE BOOK LIKE JUST 5 MINUTES AGO AND KNOWING THIS IS GONNA BE A MOVIE AND WATCH THE TRAILER WHEN THE STORY IS STILL FRESH AS HECK IN MY BRAIN IS JUST WOW. IM BLOWN AWAYYYYY This kinda reminds me of ""The Girl on the Train"" \nWhich is amazing !!! Amy Adams is an absolutely fantastic actress This reminds me of ""The girl on the train"" by Paula Hawkins. Really looking forward to see how it goes :D Wow this looks awesome. Finally an original movie. I hope it doesn\'t have a crappy ending though. Better have a good plot twist or it will ruin it. Saw the preview, read the book, now I’m ready to watch it. Please OSCARS ! Give Amy Adams Best Actress By This Performances ! This gave me anxiety for 2 minutes but I still want to watch it Oh my goddddddddd...my heart is beating so fast and im shivering..this is a superb trailer..love amy adams Amy Adams, She might get into Oscar Nom for her role... Yes, this is very similar to the Girl on the Train. I loved that movie so regardless of the similarities I am looking forward to this. amy deserves an oscar After finishing the book yesterday I can\'t wait to watch this tonight! THIS IS SO INSANE!! I LOVE IT!! Just finished the book. Movie awaited  I\'ve been watching this trailer for numerous times, I badly wanna see it!!!!! I\'m guessing I\'m not the only one who saw the trailer yesterday and immediately binge-read the book? If you liked The Girl in the Train and Gone Girl, you certainly are going to enjoy this one.\nDoes anyone have similar books to recommend? :) I have watched Amy Adams on the movie Leap Year, and she was very good there. And I will also watch this because of her. She very underrated please give the oscar to Amy Adams for this movie!!! I love those kind of movies! Can\'t wait Ava Addams did great acting in this movie  Soundtrack and story also breathtaking I read the book and now after watching the trailer, i\'m excited to see how the complex plot will be unfolded. The book was amazing. Waiting for the movie. ️️ movie plot is not that good and predictable but her acting is amazing, Amy Adams are at it again. Wowww I haven\'t even finished the book and now they\'ve made it into a movie??! Well, I\'m in We need a new trailer to premiere on Netflix next month!!! Amy adams? okay I will definitely watch it I love movies like these !!! Can you guys suggest some more ?? The best looking ginger on this planet. Oscar deserves her. I love Amy Adams sooo much. In everything!!!! Because of trailer i started reading the book and holy smokes it\'s awesome, can\'t wait to see the portrayal. Can\'t wait today is the day!!!  Amy Adams had better get an Oscar for this role!!! Anything with Amy Adams in it is worth seeing. Period. Definitely a disturbia and rear window vibe I am really excited to see this Wow that gave me chills.. I\'m terrified just finished the book. Cant wait to see this film! I love her acting...... She is extraordinary Love the book and hope the movie is as good! This is a mixture of The Girl On A Train, and The Uninvited.... love it Y\'all its finally bout to come out on Netflix in May!!  This book was incredible. Can’t wait. Even the novel is so good,  hopefully the movie is promising as the book I\'ve read the book! I SWEAR this will not disappoint!  Can’t wait to see it! OMG just yesterday i finish reading the book and it is soooo good and know they is going to be a moviee i\'m so excited i can\'t wait!!!! So excited to watch this tonight. Literally the reason why I got Netflix again! I wasn’t expecting it to be so bad but it was, even the way it was filmed seemed very Lifetime movie to me. Also, I don’t understand why so many well known actors were in it for only brief scenes (Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Anthony Mackie) my favorite disney princess, Amy Adams, back at it again with what looks like a crazy good movie I loved how they used the Dark Side alternate version from Muse! It’s so fitting. She should get an oscar. I SWEAR TO GOD IF SHE DOESN\'T WIN AN OSCAR WITH THIS ONE this movie is gonna be so good and that’s on amy adams I\'ve been waiting for this movie to come out!! Book was dope!! I’ve been waiting for this book turning into a movie  this trailer hits differently when you also have agoraphobia Omg! Beautiful trailer, stunning cast! A must watch! But first, i gotta read the book \nedit: i just finished reading the book. i like it. i don\'t particularly love but i enjoyed it. also, ngl the movie/trailer looks better this is amazing what the hell im actually excited for this It\'s something different. That\'s all I. Need to want to see it. Vim aqui só por causa do Muse...\nArrasam demais :3 I want to see this movie soooo bad its a shame they didnt add any parts where anthony mackie partakes in here considering he stars in the movie . \nhe is so underrated . Ohhh I gotta finish reading the book so I can watch this, it looks so good A relatable movie finally someone acknowledges us. Just finished the book... oh boy I can’t wait to see this GIVE AMY HER OSCAR ALREADY! I just watched a video of someone telling the story of the book and oh god I can\'t wait for this. The end is a shocker i shivered so hard my neck hurt when muse started playing. this movie seems good with the amazing amy adams and all. the book was kind of meh, but the trailer looks good I know this is so random but I really miss Amy Adam singing on movies  I hate it when trailers give almost everything away.... \n\nAnyways, read the book so I’m excited to watch this! Really enjoyed this. Nothing memorable but a fun watch. Definitely picking up a physical copy when it come out. Omg I can’t wait to watch this on Netflix tomorrow. My Friday night plan, come home from work have a nice bath and then a date with my sofa and blanket and then Netflix and chill... can’t wait  I had agoraphobia before. Thankfully my medications worked. When having medication, never never ever drink alcohol with this medication because it makes your anxiety becomes worst. I guess, the movie is about a person who is agoraphobic but at the same time an alcoholic which could lead to more anxiety that will also leads to taking the meds more than what the doctors prescribed that means she was became an addict and an output of overdosw on drug addiction. I\'m legit excited for this!!! Looking forward to this movie!  im telling you, if you\'ve read the book, this movie adaptation is a love letter to hitchcock and other noir films! now this is what i call a outstanding Role and an outstanding story ...BRAVO I LOVE Amy Adams. Every act she plays I believe in her 100 per cent, and then some. Yet, as Great as she is, Amy (and Jessica Chastain both) will likely go on ignored by the biased and prejudiced academy awards.\nHere\'s a great song about Anxiety https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q33DvcjXA7M Just finished the book and really hoping it releases soon!! WOW! THIS IS EPIC! LOOKS SO GOOD! Gary Oldman is such a good actor, i recognised him when it was written he is starring in this movie any time i see amy adams in a new project, my immediate thought is: OSCAR !!!!! It’s been Over a Month Since the Original Release date for the Movie. Disney needs to give this & Antlers New Release Dates. you got to admit, this trailer is pretty badass and amazingly stylistic AMY ADAMS IS GOLD. Danny Elfman\'s score giving me goosebumps but what else is new Can\'t wait to watch the movie This will fetch Amy Adams an oscar I just finished reading the book like Right Now and immediately looked for the trailer aaaand wow it\'s sooo promising!!!! I like how they didn\'t even show a single hint about the suspect/killer!\n\nGAHD I\'M SO EXCITED. THIS IS SUCH A GREAT BOOK WITH GREAT TWIST AND EXCEPTIONAL CHARACTERS YOU\'D LOVE TO HATE. Amy Adams.\n\nYes. Yes. Yes. Came here from the book! Absolutely amazing The book is so awesoooome  I hope the movie hits it. oooh! And detective little,in the movie he looks just as I imagined him from the book  Who’s here because of MissMangoButt ️ Halfway through the book right now, so, woo! This\'ll be the first time I ever read a book before watching the movie. when is this coming out?? i LOVE amy adams A.J Finns book comes to life and what better way than with Amy Adams Excited to watch it! This looks fantastic! It\'s finally out on netflix!! The book was a master master piece and it was so enjoyable to read Want to see this movie so badly like come out already dammit. I am still not ready for this after seeing gone girl. First I thought of ""Rear Window"" by Alfred Hitchcock. This is going to be excellent You know is awesome when Julián Moore appears! I need to watch this. Gone girl is one of my fav movie. Bet this one is great too Loved the book hope the movie lives up to it Academy award nominee Amy Adams and soon (hopefully) another nomination for her for the category for Best Actress and might be win (crossed-fingers) Ok. Ok. No more peeping at my neighbors\' houses. I repent. Geez  The book was terrific !!! Gotta see the movie still I wasn\'t interested in the movie adaptation, having read the book (and disappointed by the girl on the train movie), but they got Amy Adams... Now I\'ve got to watch this. Dammit! Just finished the book, wow SO good. The movie looks pretty close to it. Can’t wait. I just wanna see this and Antlers already  so tired of waiting. I get it\'s because of covid but at least put it on Cineplex to rent or any other website associated with a theater by location. They\'re still gonna make the money, in fact probably more since not everyone is up for sitting in a theater during these times. Another Oscar nomination for Amy Adams in next year... Amazing book!!! Can’t wait! Looks very similar to ""The Girl on the Train"" which was amazing When you have anxiety but you have to watch... the book was amazing i cant wait for this Wow! So so excited! ️ Nice movie️ will definitely watch this Movie is adapted from a book. ‘Women in the Window\', author by A.J. Finn. The story is of thriller/suspense genre. The plot is extremely twisted with a gripping ending. If the movie is based exactly like the literature, then I\'m sure audience shall surely have a thrilling viewing experience, especially at the moment when the story reveals, exactly how Anna acquires the phobia?; and when the story reveals, whether, what Anna saw was really what happened or it just a hallucination? Please watch the movie, as I\'m sure you\'re not gonna regret watching it. I AM GONNA WATCH THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY The fact that no one seems to believe her and tell her that she’s hallucinating reminds of the another movie called Fractured  Amy stays working and I love it This trailer in fantastic. Can\'t wait  Wow  this trailer is everything  I hope Amy Adams gets oscar for this. She looks good just finished the book didn\'t realize there would be a movie. look forward to it but don\'t know when it\'ll be viewable I know it\'s gonna be an amazing movie just by the fact that they used a Muse song as the soundtrack great colour pallette.Cant wait to see this.A story with twists in it. That has Alfred Hitchcock influence all over this movie. Absolutely mesmerizing trailer..Eagerly waiting for this in India ..Love Amy Adams Give her an Oscar already dammit What a strong movie..I want to see it This looks good, fantastic cast. Can\'t wait too see it. Looks thrilling. Irritating detail--the townhouse she is seen leaving at the end of the movie has an empty lot across from it and shared walls with her neighbors.  The story could not have happened in that townhouse.  Also, not the same place that was shown just a couple of minutes earlier that was the end of the row with a grander stairway up to the front door. ohh please give Amy Adams an Oscar ! I cannot wait!  The book was excellent! This trailer looks a lot better than the Netflix one Now this is a movie...Finally...Thank you The book is amazing. I haven’t seen the movie yet Is this movie ever getting released? \nIt\'s going to be a year since the trailer came out!  She deserves an award, it’s dark Listening to the audiobook gave me chills! Now I get to watch it? Merry christmas to me!!! we didn’t see it in the trailer but i’m curious as to if they’re going to acknowledge the whole story line of her husband and daughter ? Hope it\'s as good as the book. Looking quite promising. I don\'t know what Netflix Studios did to fix this long ago shelved movie, but it worked! A intense and clastophobic thriller with a outstanding and convincing performance from Amy Adams! A very dark and very entertaining psychological whodunnit! Amy Adams returns Oscar worthy for Amy!! The book was slow.But this trailer gave me  chills. I love the book sooo much!! I don\'t normally watch these types of movies but WOW... I\'m definitely watching this one!!! i know this movie is gonna be a serve i thought it was never coming out but i just found out it’s gonna be released on netflix this may! I have read this book.\nIt is lovely. I loved Gone girl, and this movie reminds of Girl on the Train, I think I\'m going to like this movie I feel like original movies are gonna make a comeback (even if they’re adaptations), so tired of remakes and nostalgia Ah, finally a movie that relates to my life I’ve read the book and I can’t wait for this Looks good. Gary Oldman for the win! I read the book, interesting twist and a good book! I\'m waiting for this movie to get released so badly How has she still not gotten an Oscar? Blasphemy. I loved this book omgggg I can’t wait I read the book so I can’t wait for this Can\'t wait to see it on Netflix GIVE AMY AN OSCAR Definitely gonna watch this!!! I loved the book. Don’t know if the movie will do justice to the book. Amy is still stunning just like how she played Jiselle in ENCHANTED  There is no way I\'m watching this movie, my heart will cut I read the book so I have a lot of expectations on this this is going to be a really good movie OMG FINALLY!!!!! AFTER LONG TIME I READ THE NOVEL!!!!!! I love this novel Omg.  Amy Adams is amazing and Jennifer Jason Leigh too?!  Wow this looks great!! Can we please talk about the novel from which this movie has taken the plot  My favorite book becoming a movie,\nI’m READYYYY Just read the book! Can’t wait Come now already ! Like when ?  When will it get released  , been waiting for this eagerly  since ages .  jus finished to read the book and i NEED to watch this movie!! Amy adams is exactly like anna fox. Shes gonna kill it. Producer: How much impact do you want to have in the society?\nThe movie: Yes. You know the feel where thrillers are scarier than horror movies  So...can we please talk about how perfect ""The Dark Side"" sounds in this trailer?  Just watched this movie love it Glad to see these types of ""Hitchcockian thrillers"" making a big comeback nowadays. When will this be released! I mean the trailer was released a year ago. I really to watch it!! I have waited for the movie since the release of this trailer. Then COVID-19 happened and the world was put on “hold” and there was no movie (not the biggest of this year’s problems, but still...). Anyway, I am grateful for this trailer because it got me to read the book, and now that I have read it, I would like to see the movie more than ever. So, no pressure, but a release date would be nice. Just finished the book. Should be great, as from the trailer, they’ve changed nothing. This feels like “rear window” mixed with “rosemary’s baby” and “Fight club” Espero que esté mejor que el libro. literally still waiting for this to be released! I don\'t think I can watch this, looks scary, but now I want to read the book This looks awesome ! I can\'t wait!!! Omg I want to get this book so much Never mind about Oscars. I hope this film does well enough so that Amy Adams continues to get work. Sad to say, but that is going to get a LOT harder, now. Wow Amy You are a masterpiece ️ The ending was pretty bad and Gary Oldman over-acted extremely but apart from that an OK movie. Amy Adam\'s performance made me cry, she was very convincing. This. Is. The. Type. Of. Stuff. I. Love. Everybody here for Amy Adams, but I’m here for Gary Oldman. girl: hey, there\'s the woman in the window!\nman: we know, there are many women in the window There is so much more than what you see in the trailer! Defs a good read too Omg I\'m so excited for this As interesting as it looks unfortunately it is pretty obvious how it\'s going to end Excuses me but she doesn\'t need an oscar. An Oscar needs her. Woahh Amy and Julianne. I can\'t wait to watch this movie. ARE THEY EVER GONNA SHOW IT?  ANYONE? Make sure you read the book before watching the movie! The book gives more details. It\'s excellent! This movie is basically like The girl on the train. Just finished listening to MissMangoButt do a summary of this - talked about how there was a movie coming out about it - and stumbled across this legendary trailer. The book was AWESOME!! hope the movie is good! you had me at the casts  Such a great story. How on earth did they manage to stuff up the movie? 1:35 is so trippy I love it Amy Adams   I miss her so much  The book has literally been on my nightstand for about 10 months now I enjoyed this movie throughout. Why? Yes it was slow paced but it built characters, premise, the shaky narrative that is so lacking in most thrillers today that are so choppy and reveal nothing about characters. Wonderful cast and performances and a plot twist that will age well and probably seal Adams and this movie into the “classics” genre Amy Adams, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman...That\'s a Hell yes, I\'m watching I\'ve just started to read that book... looks good This is going to give me anxiety......I’ll watch it for sure! It just means that it will be  a great movie  0:06 why\'d she say anxiety disorder like that she sounded like a computer or like she was asking a question or something  I finished reading the book last September so the story still fresh in my mind. Who wants a spoiler? Comment down below ️️️ If there was an intruder in my house i\'d go lock the door to my room,hide under my bed and call 911 in whispers instead of being every horror movie cliche ever lol Awesome movie with lot of twists Why doesn\'t Amy Adams get more recognition? She\'s fantastic. She shouldn\'t have to star in a Marvel movie to suddenly get world-wide attention like so many other actors nowadays. man i read the book and it was soo good Is this ever going to come out? Anybody? It was a great movie!  This is like that one Castle episode where Beckett hired actors to stage a murder case across the street man the sound design in the 2nd half of this is absolutely killer! (pun in ten did) ""Everything is a clue...""\n\nI know how it feels. One hour and forty minutes for this? I truly think that runtime is too short for all the depth they go into her psychology and past in the book. Hope it doesn\'t disappoint. I\'m on a streak with terrible film adaptations of my favorite books. smh The only person who could have pulled this character off. Amy we have missed you!!!!! I wish The Silent Patient turn into a movie and Amy Adams plays for Alicia Berenson I finally get how she feels being stuck at home now smh the book was so good, i cant wait to watch this moiveeeee I\'ve read the book and honestly i felt it was a fun book to read but nothing special. I saw one of the plot twists coming when i was just 50 pages into the book. But the movie\'s got great actors and it might be fun to watch! This looks really good! I\'ll watch anything Amy Adams is in. I adore the book fascinating story ️ I can’t wait for the movie anymore,so I read the original novel.... I read this book it was so good omg Omg this looks so good! Checking youtube right after I finished reading the novel and there indeed is the movie. I have read the book its sooo twisted!!\nYou will definitely like the plot twist! Hope the movie is as good as the book. It was a great read. My fav genre with Amy adams\nI m in Love Julianne Moore! First minute: Ehh, just a Rear Window ripoff.\n\nSecond minute: Now, we\'re talking. This is totally an interesting Movie to watch.  Anything amy is on you know it’s gonna be fire definitely gonna watch this I’m just about to read the Book  The same studio with gone girl i love it!! I didn\'t really like the movie. It should\'ve been better, I feel like it was all over the place and they didn\'t include most of the important stuff from the book. I really loved the book tho. Oh man I didn\'t recognize Gary Oldman! Wow this looks better than the book to be honest  This is her chance! Give her the oscar goddammit i can\'t wait for this movie Omg this looks amazing It comes out today. I\'m going to the movie theater with my...no, wait! look it’s the girl who should of been a princess from enchanted from didn’t get enough recognition:( OMG this is so amazing Apart from a couple of obvious add ons/changes to the original novel, this looks like a super promising adaptation! I just really hope they haven\'t used a different ending because of the test audience not liking the third act. Hopefully it\'s vice versa.\n\nEdit: Unfortunately it was not a good adaptation and was highly disappointing. Skip the film and read the book. This Is The Perfect Quarantine Movie I\'m an Agoraphobic who lives in a $5 million New York brownstone!\n\nThese movies are always so believable. Ah too much on the trailer ️ but this is look interesting af, definitely gonna watched it!! I thought this was going to be good, but it was all over the place. Perhaps the concept of the story would be a good read, and I hear there is a book, but I thought this movie was lacking depth, and had a rushed ending. If only this movie was a remake of the movie Disturbia. Now that would have been worth watching. Yaassssss... My favourite book. I love whoever saw the potential of the making book Me who finished listening to Stephanie soo’s podcast. “Rotten Mango” Looks good. Reminds me a bit of that Hitchcock movie with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. It’s like Rear Window with a Gaslight edge. I’m here for it. After watching the movie.... There r some changes in the movie..and the movie felt like real fast..\nLike theres no time pass like anyother movie.. It was straight to the main points.. The ending was a bit changed.. Wow, I LITERALLY just saw this book at the store! When i see Julian Moore in a movie i know that movie will tick This is creepier than the term creepy\nAmy Adams is crashing it  This looks bomb awesome, but the trailer gives so much away! My gosh, this looks good! This looks like the type of film u want to go in completely blind Okay wait this looks REALLY GOOD Can someone please tell me when this movie will be released? Thank in advance! I just finished watching the movie on Netflix. Some scenes shown in the trailer are not there in the movie, though there\'s a huge difference between the book and the movie. I\'ll miss these kind of movies from Fox once family oriented Disney takes over it. I\'ll miss these kind of movies from Fox once family oriented Disney takes over it. Coming out May14th on Netflix! So now I can\'t live in solitary in my own home?!\n\nThe twist in this trailer reminded me of the movie Vertigo. Any news about the premiere date? Im waiting for more than an year to watch this. This is like “ the woman in the train “ starred with Emily Blunt THIS LOOKS BOMB! on today\'s episode of will amy adams get her oscar God been waiting for this movie seems like forever Just saw the new trailer. I knew it looked familiar!  This is a similar movie to \'Rear Window\' where a photographer broke his leg and started to spy his neighbours house. He found out that his neighbour killed the girlfriend and got another woman who looked similar to her Based on the trailer alone, there are some details that are different in the book but i can see why they changed it up for the dramatics of  the movie I just finished reading the book and wow it was a plot twist and everytime i thought i understood who was the killer it WASNT so in the end i know this is a spoiler alert for you who havent read it yet .Dont read if you dont want to know who the killer is I wish it had someone other than Amy Adams as the lead. Her acting is always so stunted and feels the same as every role. Never quite does it for me A modern day twist on Hitchcock\'s Rear Window?  I\'m in!  (Just don\'t mess it up!) Wow! I can\'t wait!! What’s the opening song called??? It’s sooo good!!! Read the book! It’s great! I read it in one day. Julianne Moore plays Jane Russell in the mystery thriller. release it already! Okay, Oscar needs Amy now. I\'ll actually pay to see this. Me right now when quarantine. just looking outside from my window. Holy crap, I just started reading this book Release it already! when will it be released?! Looks like an AWESOME rehash of Hitchcock\'s Rear Window!! :O The gone girl in the window on the train.\n\nCan’t wait tho ! yasssss ! I LOVE IT ALREADY Thanks for giving us like two plot twists I’m just watched the movie and i feel like it’s inspired on The Girl on the train, the plot is similar Looks insane!!! Another Witness in the outside film, there are so many of them but always well done. So Woman in the Train Meets Rear Window, I will give it a chance for sure. Is this movie ever going to be released? Her breakup with Jim really affected her life. Man this gotta be the most legendary crossover on MCU and DCEU history My favorite actress! trailer hits different when you\'ve read the book There’s some iconic people in this movie!!! It’s gonna be ballsy IS THIS MOVIE EVER COMING OUUUUT This is an example where the society\'s law forces blame an individual\'s mental disorders as an excuse to not deal and investigate further into a very complex and dark crime scenario. Just finished the book and that *TWIST*! The movie is awesome the book was pretty good, the movie looks decent. Yes. Gary Oldman too. Yes. This looks like a modern Rear Window. I love the use of muse in the trailer This reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock\'s ""Rear Window"" ... Just finished the book. I very much enjoyed it, couldn’t put it down. & of course I am excited to see Amy Adams kill the role. But still, there is something that bugs me about it & I can’t put my finger on it. Anyone else? Amy is again coming for those awards. I enjoyed it. oh so its Rear Window. It looks pretty good though. Amy Adams is too underrated and I almost didn\'t recognize Gary Oldman Looks good, it reminds of the girl on the train. This reminded me a lot of Hitchcock’s “Rear Window” Thank you for revealing the plot twist in the trailer! Smh ️ This gonna be good  Seriously, what a lens to own as a widow. It\'s based on the novel ""women in the window"" by A. J. Finn.\n\nPlease stop assuming things and guessing the plot without reading the book.\n* The cast & the house look exactly as I imagined while reading the book * It looks like other trailers which shows full movie in just a trailer but still different because I have no idea about it. Music gives chills by the way. I’m in for this one . Fox is the best studio to make movies . But Disney needs to stay out of it . Amy adams is such a goddess Got goosebumps Yes! I will be watching! This was so good. She could’ve been a great Beverly Marsh!!! Based on the trailer,  this movie seems similar to Hitchcock\'s Rear Window. I have a feeling they\'re still waiting for the theaters to be open in order to release the movie... Maybe in 2021??? ""I have an anxiety disorder""\nOh no, please don\'t be about...\n""I\'m a Agoraphobic""\n...FML This is sooo good. it looks good but i feel like this trailer could have been better...i wonder how id feel about it if i hadn\'t read the book...it was a fun read When is this gonna be out?? Wow thanks Fox for uploading the whole film. This movie reminds me of ""The girl on the train"" it has the same vibe. The house is familiar. Like that house that has a panic room. I found the book on a free book app but then thought wait, there\'s most likely a movie and sure enough. Suspense and thriller nice to watch not boring  Gary Oldman, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Julianne Moore? I’m sold just with a cast including them Where does she get money to survive? Does she work from home? Is she an heiresses? I\'ve never read the book, I just need to know this one thing about the protagonist. i can’t wait to see this movie :/ this virus is ruining everything!!!!!! i hope it goes to prime Lesson learned: don’t be sticking your nose into other people’s business  she is the Oscar brilliant performer If Amy goes one more award season without a win..... Finally it\'s going to get released.... It\'s a new take on Rear Window. Give me the classics any day over modern remakes. OMG this movie is awesomely irritating. its such a wonderful story with incredibly anoyying main character. she might be on the right side but her act wasnt right at all.\n1. cheating on husband\n2. got her family killed by her clumsiness, selfishness, and carelessness This reminds me a bit of Hitchcock’s Rear Window This was a very good Novel Fun Fact :\n\nTHIS IS THE LAST MOVIE UNDER 20TH CENTURY FOX LOGO  Another masterpiece incoming Amy Adams and Julianne Moore in a single piece? SOLD. we need to see this I am watching it right now, making a break at around an hour. I can strongly relate to the Spongebob episode „I had an accident“, where Spongebob doesnt leave his pineapple and fights the gorilla :):) i read sharp objects too and then this.. She really got that character with a dark past in the bag If you want to be bored to TEARS and waste an hour and 40 minutes of your life watching the WORST movie that Netflix has ever put money behind then go ahead. love the darkside soundtrack Thanks!! I bought one authentic book and I’m really expect for the grand movie playing!!!!!!!! When does the book start getting interesting? This trailer gives so much of the story away. lol Are there any updates when this is gonna be released?? Doesn’t this remind you of the movie “What lies beneath” This trailer looks better than the Netflix one, I hope they haven\'t removed the rain scene and someone\'s in my living room scene. This is dope  It’s reminds me the “Rear Window” movie I would love to watch this. They didn\'t have to do too much to make her look the way she is...looks like my neighbour ""They had us in the second half, not gon lie."" Can\'t we just appreciate the amazing cover of MUSE - The Dark Side ? The novel is so much better and cannot be expressed in a movie and how can she afford the house if not going outside to work? it looks really good This was the best book! i just finished watching this now, if you are looking for the sign if is this to watch? this is it! the trailer may have given too much info but the whole movie was FREAKIN FIRE. WATCH IT NOW AND WATCH AMY ADAMS KILL THIS ROLE This reminds me of Rear Window. It’s gonna be good They gave too many spoilers in the trailer  It\'s been 11 months since the release of trailer. When will this get show??? So like, are we gonna riot if she doesnt get nominated? Shes been snubbed so many times. Hell her not winning for Nocturnal Animals was crazy Is this coming out on DVD since all the theatres have been closed? Good movie, very good ending 9.5/10 That knife scene is oooh so good she should have recorded what she saw so she could have proof instead of trying to convince everyone she\'s not crazy. Just been watching The Office seasons 1 and 2 again.  Amy Adams appears in 3 episodes and in her second appearance she does not even get a ""Guest appearance"" mention in the titles at the end.  Hah Hah.  Now she is a 6 times Oscar nominee. A perfect novel from Gillian flynn This is such a good book isn\'t it coming out on Netflix? I think this is going to be like What Lies  Beneath but with a crazy twist. So the movie is out! Let me know if you watched it and you think whether it’s worth it or not ""How many Oscar nominees do you want?""\nProducers: ""Yes.""

Greatest actor of our generation, Morgan I miss the 80s when I see movies like this being made =[ Hollywood wants Ruby Rose to be something she\'s not very badly. A heroine. They see potential. She did very well in John Wick and now they are just simply giving her a chance. ere were actual studio executives who approved this trailer. they watched it and said \'yep this is a good trailer. go ahead and release it.\' I was almost under the impression that Sinead O\'Connor was trying to make a comeback in movies!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣Sorry Ruby! It’s never a good sign when you feel like you’ve seen the whole story just from the trailer.it’s like they string all the good bits together and it comes to two minutes so she threw a grenade at a guy, ran to her bike, jumped on, put on her helmet, started it, and rode away before it blew..  only in Hollywood Ruby Rose as a bad-ass is sooooooo unconvincing. Hollywood really wants ruby rose to be in action roles... Literally watched the whole trailer in Morgan Freeman\'s voice 😂😂 Okay, so a person who has extraordinary skills who used to work for a powerful secretive organization has now been called back into service to do one last job, involving extremely dangerous work in which highly financed and heavily armed bad guys want to kill our hero but instead are... let\'s see now...vanquished. That was the whole movie in a matter of minutes This looks really good! 👀🙌🏻 Morgan Freeman: My man. The voice. The best actor LOVE MORGAN FREEMAN WITH ALL MY HEART AND ALWAYS WILL Ruby Rose seems to be in everything. Looks like a lifetime or college movie but for Morgan Freeman I’m sold I believe this more than her fist fighting grown men and winning Lmao the grenade waited for her to walk away majestically before blowing up... 🤣🤣🤣 It\'s amazing what they can do now with A.I. robots... but you can still tell it\'s a mannequin. that grenade explosion after half an hour 😂 I need to get my daughter back\nYou\'ll get your daughter back when you can act\nYou bastard you can\'t do this to me\nI didn\'t do this Ruby. You did. Morgan Freeman received more money for vaccine advertising than for the last films he made. That explains a lot about how it\'s better to burn than to fade. One of the few actors who gets older the worse it gets. I will rent this only because Morgan Freeman is in it! This may be the most cliche driven trailer I\'ve seen in a long time.  They should just call it ""Action Tropes & Cliches,"" LOL!  😂 They will make an action hero out of Ruby Rose if it’s the last thing they do. i just watched the whole movie thanks to this trailer. thanks for saving me time and money. Welp, Morgan Freeman definitely had a good run. Looks low budget but I love old school action This looks really cool! This movie is gonna be amazing, no matter what anyone says, can\'t wait to see it. Y\'all only like highly rated actors but these other actors are bringing some pretty dope movies Enough already of 83 year old Morgan Freeman in action movies....in any film! Halfway through the movie so far but I have one thing to say, ""What\'s the matter, Mr. Freeman, were you that hard up for money?!?"" I see Ruby Rose in a movie...I walk away! When it is Morgan Freeman, there is no time for popcorn.. You\'re sitting at the edge of the seat!😎😎 Motorcycle sliding under a moving truck....well that\'s innovative and daring and something nobody has ever seen before in a predictable b-grade action movie. I don’t need to see the movie now — I just saw it I\'m guessing this is how it went down....\nHey, Morgan.  Im calling to see if youd star in our movie, Vanquish!\nMorgan:  Eh, well, you know how old I am.\nYou can shoot all your scene sitting down.  We\'ll put your char in a wheelchar. Morgan did this in his sleep. In one take. And donated the money to charity. Ruby rose is up there with Leonardo di caprio, one of the best at her job! In John Wick 2 I actually thought Ruby Rose was gonna be a big star.  But dam the movies she\'s been in are the shits. Ruby Ruby\nKeep making movies\nCause it\'s action we want and action we need Just saw the trailer and its like the Scott Adkins film Seized. They took his son he was forced to kill bad people and every time Mario Van Peebles would talk to him to say here have a few mins with your son you deserve it. Having Mario keep saying pappa to Scott Adkins was horrible to hear. Also the body guards had no speechlines so had to do this annoying look at each other all the time. I watched Ruby Rose in SAS Rednote today was ok but few scenes were weird. How did the hero suddenly think she was on the train. And why hero of the film when proposed to his gf she said no until he cried lol. No spoiler to the fact she makes it to ""One more stop\'. Not every Morgan Freeman movie can be a classic. This one seems not even worth watching for free. Can\'t blame Morgan for cashing a little :) Normally Morgan freeman and I’m in,this one is questionable though. Morgan Freeman. this movie will be rad! Freeman and Rose... have... reached new heights...of glory...\n\nIs what a paraphrase of my review would be. But it would actually be: Freeman and Rose both have reached new heights of sucking. It would be an act of glory and mercy from God if this movie could be purged from my mind. So about the movie… let me share my experience with you:\n\nI´m at minute 00:26:54 and I cannot comprehend how did I got here (yes I was counting the seconds). Two amazing actors, such potential and… what a colossal piece of garbage! When does she put on the suit and powerslide the enemies to death? Someone saw THE DOORMAN and THE COURIER (no not Cumberbatch but the Oldman one) and smashed it together tight enough until this popped out. Damn, I thought they were going to make a movie about the game VANQUISH Why does it feel like freeman is going down the same route as Willis and Cage now.. 🤷🏼\u200d♂️ What do you do when your about to watch this movie and the trailer says no it\'s dumb? Needs more rocket knee sliding power armor You can tell Morgan Freeman is not even trying anymore when he is playing a former police commissioner... Who has earrings. When did Morgan Freeman join the Bruce Willis movie club? morgan freeman on level-1 autopilot phoning it in for the usual ""we need a top name for our shite movie"" paycheck Decent movie So it\'s a motorcycle movie? \nThere\'s already loads of mo\'bike vids on YuTu 😈 I doubted it long but this will be the first movie with Morgan Freeman I\'m not going to watch. So has Ruby Rose has officially taken over Steven Segal and Jason Statham in the \'predictable action\' genre 🤔 Poor Morgan Freeman reduced to act in a low budget actioner with Ruby Rose. His career has touched the bottom of the sink. I bet at the end she gets her daughter back. No real surprise in it 😂 Get rid of that for me....luv it! If it wasn\'t for Morgan Freeman this would be a totally B movie. Still is, just with a high budget actor. Ruby was good in John Wick and passable in Orange is the new black but has just bombed in every single thing she\'s been in since... She has a face for film but that makes her a good extra NOT a lead actress. Not that the terrible scripts that she had to vomit up to the screen helped her any, those hack \'writers\' have even less talent than her. Oh and the poster for it is CHEEEEZY AF! I thought I was experiencing a Mandela Effect and that this was the 90\'s movie ""The Bone Collector"" with a paralyzed Morgan instead of Denzel 🙈 Ruby Rose is like fetch.. she’s just not gonna be a thing. So from now, we will see all the movies we have seen before but the heroes will be women. Let\'s teach the whole generation that a real woman behaves like a desperate man. I will skip this one. All this B grade movie needs now is Michael Madsen and it\'s a complete B grade package I just don\'t understand why almost everytime there\'s a woman in action films being a badass people just say she\'s taking on a man\'s role or being used to push an agenda, like come on, it\'s 2021, stop being sexist!\nI\'m not even talking about Ruby Rose, I\'m talking about women in general who take on action roles. I thought to myself oh morgan freeman this should be good, he isnt in bad movies.. Saw ruby and was like oh.... finished the trailer and -_- i was wrong. Why do they keep trying to make Ruby Rose out to be some kind of bad ass Assassin? Looks Good To Me. Big Ruby Rose Fan. Just Pre-Ordered It & Saved $$5.00 From Regular $$ On Amazon Let me guess..Ruby continues to beat the crap out of guys twice her size. FAIL. VANQUISH (2021) 𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥-𝐌𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐞 [𝐇𝐃]\n\n𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 ► https://t.co/tVl7VinYpx?amp=1 What bigwig in Hollywood does Ruby Rose have incriminating photos of that she gets to keep making horrible movies...? Few seconds in\nMe: looks good\nSee’s Ruby Rose\nMe: yeet Awesome ! Literally watched the whole movie in the trailer😅😂😂😂 She\'s a monotone actor. It\'s acting when u can play different characters, not the same one everytime, we get it youre gay. Life doesn\'t consist of only gays they are a lot more characters to play that\'s what defines a good actor. The title fits considering the audience its looking for lol I might watch this but only for Morgan Freeman When i see Morgan inn ..cant be bad ..👍 Morgan freeman just did this movie for free. He just wanted an electric bike with amazing range I was hoping this was like the game Fast forward the 1st 6mins..the film doesn’t even start until then..in fact fast forward the whole movie,it’s a shocker 🤮🤮🤮 Morgan went off script “get rid of her for me”. Very nice movie trailer I love this Hollywood movie Must be hard times with the Corona when Morgan Freeman is doing B movie\'s!😅🏳️🤦\u200d♂️ Why are they do DESPERATELY trying to make this girl an action star??? The way she said *I need to get my daughter back* at 1:36 it felt as if a teenager is asking for burger. I am no actor but that was a worst way for delivering such a depressing line. Don\'t like this actress at all. I\'ve seen it already 100 times before . with a much more beautiful lead . in my country there is a saying : ""daca baba avea un coi ... se ducea la razboi !!!"" . it translate : ""if the old lady had one testicle ... she could go to war !!!"" . it\'s awful . wait... so this is Batgirl without batgirl haha i love morgan freeman Here we are with yet another woman hero movie that’s makes men out to be the bad guys and women the hero Still waiting for Se7en 2 😆 I aged during the opening credits … 👴 Not even Morgan Freeman could save that movie from being so bad i almost fell asleep for real and its The first time i saw a movie taking 6 minutes to start. Jeez It\'s been seven hours and fifteen days, since you took my daughter away. Where can i get that electric bike? The range is amazing lol How much did they pay Morgan Freeman to sit on a wheelchair Is this being released straight to \nyard sale/flea market? Sorry but is hard to believe that someone who weighs 50 kilos can be badass... I see Morgan Freeman I assume he\'s playing some omniscient character, or potentially God.\n\nBtw is that that Charlotte chick from Sex and the City?😳 Morgan Freeman has always been old I wanna go to the movies and this movie was an option but I’m not sure anymore And the Oscar goes too?!?!?!?! So, this is set up like the progression in a video game but with Morgan Freeman doing one last narration ... I might have to pass. \n\nI\'ll probably still watch it but suspect a disappointment is in my future. I used to laugh whenever i saw Rose in an action movie but it\'s not funny anymore, it\'s just sad, i feel sad for both her and the audience. Anyone can be a good actor if they work under a talented dedicated director, but these woke people does not want to work hard, they want to be praised as they are that\'s their whole motto. Can she sing like Sinead o conner🎤🎼its been seven hours and fifteen days, when you took my daughter away🎼🎼🎼 So, she left Batwoman to play in a John wick knockoff...?? Hollywood ruined the name vanquish for this may the awesome and bad ass that is vanquish the video game be the first to pop up forever Morgan must be need another boat because ain\'t no way he settling for this crap Well I just seen the movie all in this trailer. Thank you for the worst John Wick action movie they even dragged our mate Morgan Freeman down too, covid hit him hard also ura tudo: Final Girl, vingança, doce vingança, Jogos Vorazes uma pitada de o albergue e joga 50 tons de cinza por cima só pra atrair a atenção e está feito este trailer Hollywood is soo bad..legendary actors are forced to act in shitty movies..because big budget movies don’t hire them Ruby rose for miltiple times proves that acting it\'s NOT her thing lol Morgan Freeman literally phoning it in I\'ve seen a lot of rubbish but this one is at the top of the pile.\nFirst it was bruce Willis now its Morgan Freeman they must be really desperate to say yes to these movie parts. Straight to DVD... This trailer looks like a 2010 Movie Its brilliant I see her name and just know I do not need to watch the drivel. Not a fan of ruby rose lmao ima give it a shot....Best action movie out as of now is “Nobody” 10/10⭐️ Ruby Rose and Morgan Freeman. COUNT ME IN I am a simple man. I see Ruby Rose, and I skip it. Problem solved. I\'m coming from the future to warning you that you will regret if you watch this movie!  Thank me later... Morgan, really.....? This deep? 6 mins of opening credits 😂 Wow, the trailer looks like a poorly made trailer for a b movie! My brain literally can\'t comprehend it at all because Morgan freaking Freeman is in it! Oh Morgan, how far you\'ve fallen. Am I the only one getting serious B-movie vibes from this???? Title of the soundtrack, anyone? Ruby Rose is the new Steven Seagal ""The Doorman"" was already so bad.\nThis one looks even worse. ""Побеждать"" No emotion and acting skills required.  Just act cool the moment I saw ""batwoman"" I was like I\'m out!! Ruby Rose can\'t act to save her life 😆😆 Not gonna lie buut this movie looks like it was made in 2012. Very basic storyline but A+++ for the effort and resources DAMN Morgan Freeman must have been desperate for money to agree to do this movie. Morgan Freeman must need a paycheck. Morgan Freeman as the bad guy?  That\'s enough to get me to watch. It will be at the dollar store soon. Lol come on Morgan Freeman you\'re better than this. Is this a pilot for batwoman? 😂 Ruby rose 🤩 Come one Morgan , you dont need the money :( Every movie Ruby Rose is in, is made to launder money. Anyone know what the song is that\'s playing in the background, please trying to make this girl an action Anyone else notices how her accent changes between takes? Terrible accent coach 😂 Wow 2021 really fucked up the movie industry she wore one costume from start to finish. Oh goodness 😳 0:14 when you are forced to get up from your grave to pay taxes. They keep trying but I just don\'t buy her as a badass Why did Morgan Freeman agree to do this one? Another one for the bargain bin, I reckon. Sbe can never be what you are trying her to be. . . I wish they\'d stop casting Ruby in stuff. Don\'t care for anything she\'s been in, or for her in general. the budget is so low, ruby wearing same clothes entire movie. Why does this look like a TLC movie? xD I see Ruby, I see flop. american: ""there\'s too many people""...\nnon-american: ""there are too many people""... Trailers no matter how bad the movie are meant to make you wanna watch.\n\nI saw Morgan\'s name was fooled. Stop hating on the movie before u watch it.  . YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS BISH RUBY ROSE COUNT ME IN 😍 Who sings the song in this trailer?Please someone let me know \U0001f972 ive never seen ruby in a movie where shes not kicking ass :D Seria melhor ter visto o filme do pelé IT\'S A BURNING GRENADEEE RUUUNNNN....but put your helmet...safety first ;) Norman treeman \n\nPicture him as Groot Ruby Rose 😍 Movie was good Ruby Rose with a kid?? You\'re gonna have to sell this predetermined failure A LOT HARDER 😂🤣😂🤣👎🏻👎🏻 Threat level Midnight: Part 2: Morgan Scarn Chronicles \n                      ""What in SCARNation?!"" Whoever has Morgan Freeman under a spell please release hm.....this is really bad Why are all these old timers going too low in box office.....so sad Y’all can do better than this!! This movie needs some spice the trailer is so down to start with. I don’t think Rose can act. Wow so G 🤨 not Sarcastic... More like WTF, 🙄Nope that was terrible! 😒 Dumb....  An Morgan Freeman is One Of My Favorite Actors of All Time!!!! So Morgan Freeman owes the IRS? One of the baddest movies i have ever seen She\'s very beautiful but I don\'t think acting is her cup of tea.  Maybe she can work behind the scenes and still work in the entertainment industry or take a break from the camera and practice a little more.  With time, she may improve. THE GIRL WITH THE LOW BUDGET TATTOO The movie Era has died...and it can\'t even be revived with big names like Washington , Freeman ,De Niro etc....Series and Documentaries and are more interesting in my opinion!!! What a crap Fest. Did Morgan Freeman need the money did I miss something? Movies an hour and a half, you spend half hour watching her drive around looking constipated. Note to self, don\'t watch anymore Ruby Rose movies or shows. The shortest review ever.\n\nCrap. I am a huge Morgan Freeman fan and normally I watch everything with him in. But this one I will skip. The trailer did nothing to me or for me.  A simple concept action film with a woman lead without any adding . This $hit only happens in movies. It\'s Sinead O\'connor with big ears! Oh my,  poor morgan freeman is now doing low budget movies i\'ll just watch Liam\'s taken again instead Why does it take 6.5 minutes to start the movie? Quaint. Promises to be bemusing. Seems like a “B” movie. intro is to long than the action scene! Morgan freeman had some early dues to pay... And he had to sign this shyte project This is bullshit, where is Sam Gideon and the ARS suit? I want to see Sam defeat his Russian rival Zhaitsev. 2 Guns , bald hair. It seems to feel like ""the HITMAN"" The wokeness just keeps on comin.... How could a movie with Morgan freeman look so fucking bad Is it ok for gay people to play straight people then, when there are so many straight actor that could do the job? Cool movie trailer I don\'t think the actors are the problem with this trailer, it\'s just a really badly made trailer I like her in SAS MOVIE Cant stand ruby rose shed ruining every action film shes in From Shawshank Redemption to this sh*t. Wth, Morgan ? There are no more Man for this Kinder of job Did they seriously dub engine noises on a harley livewire? This is Nebula, right? I just wanna know the song In the trailer Why the hell have Morgan Freeman did movie like this ? This was a waste of plastic to make a DVD and a Great actor Morgan Freeman\'s time . I was going to watch this but I just did McLaren GT 🥵 is the movie good? What\'s the ringtone in morgan freeman phone! Film Select has a woman I do not recognise and therefore ignored. FREEMAN is what made me check the trailer. Thank Morgan for me later. A cheap Angelina Jolie playing a cheap John Wick... Mmmmm he\'s still alive dont waste your time to watch this...one of the worst movie in 2021...feel sorry for Morgan Freeman...\nWorth -1 star. This girl again? Ffs just PICK A REAL man instead of a girl who looks like one! Hollywood, come up with something original. Good Grief. Ruby Rose?  no thank you. Did they give away too much in the trailer? i though it was about the game Morgan Freeman??? Yes! \nI see Ruby.........no no no. Skip! Don\'t waste your time.Shit is dog shot on a hot summers day and that\'s being complimentary.Run far away john wick the female rendition Bye bye Denzel,Nicholas,Chuck.Time for only female bad heroes.   :( Ruby Rose... PASSSS that same house at the start is where they filmed the movie ""cop out"" its where the mexicans live Why is Morgan Freeman so broke? Just saw it. Literally the worst movie I\'ve ever seen in my life Once again a 90 pound woman doing impossible and imaginary things of fantasy!.… It does not work \nIt didn\'t work in Batwoman and now it just keeps getting worse!\nStop The Movie Madness! 😠 Ya...think I’ll skip that one, thanks.. YES another Ruby Rose movie I probably won\'t watch. Did anyone watched it ? Coz it seems like a very low budget and I don’t wanna waste my time to quote Keemstar:\nG A R B A G E This looks like a bootleg female john wick Just why Morgan why ? didn\'t she play this before?? I wonder if any of these Hollywood stars read stuff on utube?\nBecause I think they would be so ashamed of there acting I guess Liam Neeson is getting too old, they had to find someone else... Morgan Freeman? Maybe taxes to pay? Or Like Bruce Willis signs before reading the scripts now. why does this look so low budget...... Her screen presence is that of a stale lays potato chip ! Why oh why ?.... Am I the only 1 that thinks she’s a bad actor? 🤷🏾\u200d♂️ Morgan Freeman doesn\'t fit this character this is how i think of Morgan freeman...…..\n\n\nI have to remind myself that some birds aren\'t meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they\'re gone. I guess I just miss my friend. Morgan is doing low budget movies why.. I like Ruby Rose Guys whats the ringtone name ? Or wish phone does morgan freeman have plzz help Wow another sjw hero remake of already explored concepts. Cant believe Morgan Freeman took part in this, looks like they got to him too. Instead of this, I highly recommend watching Collateral 2004 with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. The entire movie is one huge red pill. Is it me or is the color grading in this movie weird? I like Ruby Rose, but Hollywood needs to stop trying to make her into an action star...it\'s not working, & she\'s not believable as the tough tomboy. What\'s with the trailer...? it\'s almost like a low budget film By the way, the Studs Pussy Cat in West Hollywood no longer plays porn...in this ""covid crisis,"" only MAINSTREAM FILMS...\n\nSAW THIS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO OR SO AT STUDS... she gave up batwoman for a movie that wont even be remembered in the next couple of months Yeah, big misuse of Morgan This is another Batwaman timeline Absolutely horrible! I can\'t believe two top notch actors signed on to this smdh.... Thank you but no thank you! Saw Morgan Freeman. Was excited to see the movie. \nThen I saw it starred Ruby Rose. Sorry but she really is bad, bad bad bad actress. \nWhat\'s up Morgan ???! I saw morgan freeman...so i press like...take care n goodluck Looks like a waste of time and energy Ruby Rose has been a total bust as a movie star. Morgan Morgan Morgan......what are you doing? Please stop putting Ruby Rose in Movies! 2.3 IMDB wow. I don\'t get the hype around Ruby Rose. She\'s borderline talentless. There are so many more actresses that would nail ""femme fatale"" action roles better than her. Bootleg Jane Wick Looks like the studio has spend all of its budget on Morgan Freeman. The cinematography looks shitt and cheap an electric motorcycle that sounds like a inline 4 japonese bike, oh and it is a harley davidson .so much wrong !!!! Why is it that these once great & still great take these stupid ass movie roles Bruce Willis,Morgan Freeman , Nicolas Cage just to name a few just sad Does anyone know the song name ? A whooping 6m:18sec was used for intro i.e,  cast. i think i\'ll pass Very Low budget Movie.. Even the Video colour says it all. Don\'t know why Morgan Freeman had to accept to be part of this movie on his age.. is he that desperate for money 💰🤔 I watched it. Not worth the time. Don\'t make the same mistake I did. Nothing compares to you hehehe looks a like Same plot, hollywood come oooon!!!!! why do i feel like this really sucks ? oh ruby rose at a starring role \n\nanother flop incoming Whats the songs name ?? Why was this movie recorded with an Iphone? This movie doesn\'t deserve your precious time.  Don\'t watch it. I KNOW JOHN WICK..........................YOU MADAM, ARE NO JOHN WICK!! Dont forget the sacred task of Necessary thumbs down for ruby rose What song is that? DVDs located at Walgreen right next to the beef jerky aisle play your guitar jimmy hendrix demon actor .... I came for hannahstockings All scenes nighttime? Хрень какаята а не фильм, морган фримен хороший актер но не для таких фильмов Ruby Rose... why John Wick who? Very disappointing ..😐 Looks wack to me Ruby Rose is boring and unconvincing, john Wick is as close as she has and likely will ever get. This looks like a CW pilot from 10 years ago... but with the same annoying girl power music that failed to sell the last half dozen of her projects. Don\'t waste your time watching this movies. It sucks!\n\nI am shocked that an Oscar nominated actor would agree to make this mess! Isnt that the lesbian who doesnt know how to act? She looks like an Android! TBH, an android can probably pull off more expressions then she can! Why did she even bother with Batwoman??!   Far better use of her talents. hollywood: men bad. lesbian woman good. eh? I don\'t feel it. Couldn\'t find a better cast? Looks low budget No way a girl hero. Woke BS.  Movie gonna tank. Release Date Why is Morgan Freeman in such a bad movie? Freeman plays a week role, Characters are weak. Don’t waste your time here Surprised ol\' Morgan Freeman is in such a bad movie!!! I refuse to support you after batgirl. This movie is a trap for MF... Why is in a dvd movie for? Looks like a bad straight to DVD movie. Surprised to see Morgan Freeman in this kind of bad film. Ruby rose is a good action actress. But hollywood using her for trash movies. Why Morgan? So batwoman and Lucius fox working together Woman action movies...yawn. I got so bored I forgot I was watching a trailer liongate no..... no liongate Noooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!! Hmm, I  can watch this free, yet this trailer doesn\'t do it for me.   why? ...Because it seems like a weak version of THE Transporter done on a motorcycle ridden by a  chick that looks a dude which  doesn\'t appeal to me either . I really hoped this would be a good Movie. But it is not! Ruby Rose cant carry a movie and Morgan Freeman is not helping. The cars chasing her on the Bike could ram her a dozent Times and this Movie has more Cuts than the 3 96 hour movies together. Is jeremy fragance ? Looks like top quality crap 💩 lol when is this chick gonna pursue a different career? the baddest movie i have ever seen Always Ruby Rose??? WTF happen to movie industry... Ruby Rose is one of the most annoying actors ever! She just has the sammmmmmmmeeeee speil in every damn movie, it\'s like someone wants her to be something relevant but she just doesn\'t have it! This film is bleh. Bland characters. Ruby Reds smart aleck grin and Freeman saying X more stops isnt enough. The chase scenes are nothing. Freeman is way above this stuff. Watch The Courier, its waaaay better. Bruce Willis and Nicolas Cage is well known to make crap movies these days but when Morgan Freeman joins them i start to wonder ... WTF is going on in that movie heaven !?. 👎 Don’t vanquish your money on this Why do they keep using Ruby Rose?? she cant ACT!! and couldn\'t fight her way out of a paper bag!! Well the movie is trash...I just came here to see if the trailer was trash too...it was..but always better than the movie...imma walk outta here now🚶🏿🚶🏿🚶🏿 Can anybody tell me what the f**k i just watch??? Hell nahh!!!!! 😫😫 no hand fight ,, This is not Morgan Freeman,this is Angelina Jolie after botox terapy. Turned off after 5 mins ..music playing above dialogue wastes films ..like wind chimes playing in background..dont waste your time with this pish batwoman feat lucius fox Skip the first 7mins. All stupid credits Why don’t I like this actress? I’ve only seen the first Batwoman episode, which I hated. It feels like I should give her a chance but looking at her expressions and style in this trailer, it still doesn’t convince me. Just curious, anybody here interested in watching this? meh... no thank you... sorry Freeman... ""From the writer of Bad Boys and Midnight Run"" those movies are old as fuck lol Ruby you are so bad,in the future every movie where you act i will pass and i think so many people too..Do something else i m scared that actress like you will be in the common. Another low budget movie This one from netflix? looks like the crap they put out. A very lame and dumber version of Taken. I\'m grateful for all the people making movies, but this one looks really bad Low budget effects THE GIRLS:18+ ARE  RESETE.UNO\n\n\n\nYoutube: This is fine\n\nSomeone: Says \'\'heck\'\' I LOVE Morgan Freeman, but this movie looks like it sucks ass. I don\'t think so. Gess Morgan Freeman is out of money one of the worst movies I\'ve ever seen...It has the lowest rating. WHY MORGAN ? She\'s pretty \'n all, but she can\'t act.\nRuined Orange\nRuined Batwoman\nI\'d love to watch the new Morgan Freeman film but... Hollyweird is really trying hard  to push this talentless chick. It\'s not working She is not action star material, at best, a supporting actor stop trying to make ruby rose a thing :/ . also even morgan freeman looks bad in this. holy fuck how do you write something so bad morgan freeman looks bad :( Joanna Wick? Boring script has been done so many times Arnold the transporter gone in 60 seconds. So Dated should go straight to DVd Boring script has been done so many times Arnold the transporter gone in 60 seconds. So Dated should go straight to DVd doesnt look good at all. You see, it looks like a decent movie, no she feminism be pushed hear, and the main female lead seems like it\'s going to work. Hollywood\'s finally catching a clue It just looks ugly plain and simple this movie good? looks like ANOTHER trash movie.....\nsomebody watched this ? Ewwww Ruby Rose get it away. Very lazy is a action garbage Fast And furious have more action even Ronin, the tension isn\'t enough her show the batwoman is even worse Morgan Freeman joined the low budget movie club with Nicolas Cage and Bruce Willis... so sad. This movie was so bad, could not watch half! Another rich criminal movie...  Ugh. why is Morgan on this Atrocious acting, atrociously painfully bad dialogue and screenwriting, atrocious direction, dismal photography, editing, music, sound recording.... Jesus, even Freeman is bad, every cell in his body must be rebelling against being in that trainwreck, at least I hope this paid for his electricity bill. This is such a pile of horrendous garbage, at least the cheesy B flicks from the 80\'s had a sort of charm to them. Hate this actress .  I donno am I alone in this but mannnn I can\'t stand her in whatever movie she is . It looks and feels like a shitty  Steven seagal movie even he turned down... i don\'t see this movie gaining more than 3 or 4 out of 10. The trailer was so bad I couldn\'t finish it. My opinion. Sad Rose can\'t even act, why is she able to get so many roles lately?\nOh right because she\'s a woman and lesbian The main character is straight. Why wasn\'t the role given to a straight actress? According to the woke mob\'s logic only gay people are allowed to portray gay characters onscreen, so why doesn\'t that logic apply to straight characters? Ruby rose, tattoos on the whole body, shewed head, I don\'t like her get up Ruby Rose = not gonna watch Looks as shit as Olga\'s The Courier... THIS LOOKS... like garbage. Ruby Rose has ZERO screen charisma, bland and boring. She was okay in John Wick 2 and I really really wanted to like her in stuff, but she\'s not believable as an action star.  This is a straight to dvd redbox $1 rental... MAYBE. So bad wasted my time 😣 VANQUISH(2021) ❖ Fúll MöVíé ❖\n➽  https://arax-movies.xyz/movie/804435/vanquish.html\n\nAll Subtitles, why is morgan freeman in this movie? is he broke.

She is such a bad actor. This movie SUCKED, bad👎🏽 I hate the time I wasted watching this movie 👎👎👎👎👎😠😠 I think Morgan Freeman knows that at this stage in his career, he can just sit and read dialogues and people will watch the movie. Great to see Morgan Freeman appearing in a student film like this I just wish Morgan Freeman would do one last great film. Because this clearly isn\'t it. Rest In Peace to Morgan Freeman’s career I\'ve actually thought of a similar movie idea once, where after the female main character\'s life long, closest attached best friend goes away for several months, he comes back as a criminal who forces her to do his wills. He goes after people she knows who he thinks is bad for her while also forcing her to do crime with him, or else he\'ll kill her new best friend. The movie should be called \'best friend\' something. The fact that this is getting a theatrical release really shows the state of theaters right now Not even Morgan Freeman can save Ruby Rose\'s horrible acting skills. Why does this look like a straight to DVD movie This scored 2.3 on IMDB ...well done! I have no problem with female action stars if they are believable (example: Charlize Theron in Atomic Blonde and Mad Max Fury Road), but can Hollywood please stop trying to make a 90-pound 5 ft tall Ruby Rose an action star?  It\'s laughable I love these low budget direct to video movies. Sad to see Morgan Freeman in one but i guess a pay check is a pay check As a low budget filmmaker this makes my work look so superior to yours thank you Hollywood Bruce and Nic Cage are saying : \n“Welcome to the club Morgan Freeman” God damnit, I thought this would be about the amazing old high paced game \'Vanquish\'. Can I get an honest review on this movie from someone who has seen it plz? I would like to watch it, but if it was truly no good then I won\'t. I love action movies so, if it is action-packed and not a bad storyline then it will be a winner for me :) I think Ruby assumed John Wick 2\'s success was some sort of indication she belongs in the action/revenge flick genre. She doesn\'t. I am gonna love this duo Hollywood: hey morgan will you be in our movie\nMorgan Freeman: fine but i can\'t be bothered to stand up\nHollywood: hired the new season of batwoman looks pretty crazy they must have up the budget ""From the writer of Bad Boys and Midnight Run""  No way! Those classics? Ruby Rose is the new Cara Delevingne. both kisses of death to any movie they are in! My twin sister and I are huge fans of Ruby Rose and we can\'t wait to see her and another action-packed movie Came here for Morgan, left because of rose. This was made in the year 2000, right? It sure felt like it. Who thought of The bone collector 1999, same plot by Denzel Washington paralysed and guiding Angelina Jolie to walk the grid on several crime scenes to solve a case. \nEvery person who’s interested in this movie should see that one before  It hurts me to see Morgan\'s career going down this path Ruby Rose should get an Oscar for this Great another movie I can fall asleep to it will  probably take me five whole years to see this movie in its entirety lol We\'re a long way from Morgan Freeman berating Denzel Washington to ante up in Glory. Movie Budget -\nMorgan Freeman: $10 million\nEverything else: $10,000 that throwing grenade scene was hilarious. Morgan Freeman played literally God in Bruce Almighty to this.... \n\nDamn. Right, so it’s one of those movies where the name actor doesn’t leave the one room in which all their scenes are shot. What, was Bruce Willis too busy to do this one? It\'s funny that they added engine noises to an electric motorcycle (the Harley-Davidson Livewire). Oh good another Ruby Rose film... Did they give away that Freeman can walk in the graveyard at 1:10 ? not to mention he is standing at 1:11 when he answers the phone. Would that not have been a twist? It’ll be one of those movies you just stick on in the background whilst you’re working and you hardly watch it I bet Morgan Freeman is only in this for 7 minutes. How do movies like this still get made? Thought we stopped trying these in the 2010s Jaw Dropping! Morgan was able to do another great low budget movie for making this I\'d guess Morgan Freeman as Morgan Freeman, the only time he acted was in lean on me Bruce Willis, Nick Cage, Ruby Rose and Freeman need to do a Movie together NOW!! Is it me or does Morgan Freeman loves doing Lionsgate movies Wow, this looks absolutely terrible. I guess Ruby is choosing to make her career in movies as a badass girl, with no scope for acting but fighting and killing. Not even Morgan Freeman can make this worth watching. Oh FFS... Stop casting Ruby Rose as an action hero.  She had the physical presence of a stick insect :-D ""Oh boy oh man, Hollywood\'s already made the cinematic version of Mikami\'s Platinum Games\' game ?!""\n""Oh..."" I won\'t hate on this just cause it\'s Ruby Rose but... It looks completely mediocre It\'s like when you\'re putting a pc together and go\n\nGPU: rtx 3080 - Morgan Freeman\nCPU: Pentium III - Ruby Rose Hasn’t this been done a million times? Lack of expression is equal to lack of acting skill. We call it Ruby Rose. And here i hoped that it would be an adaptation of the game. Dissapointed, but morgan freeman so ill probably watch it The Fast, The Furious, The Vanquished! Go into action on a motorbike, after all affords little to no protection against automatic weapons.  Good luck Agent Baldy. Ruby Rose is sooooo stunning!! looks good :) It\'s nice they can find a role for Mr. Freeman that isn\'t God.  But, honestly, I thought there were SAG rules that only he could play God. Morgan freeman hardly moved his wheel chair a few metres in the movie and with a remote control blows up all the bad guys and himself in the building... Morgan failed to save Ruby\'s acting. Lolll! They\'re not even pretending about wanting only morgan freeman\'s voice. He\'s literally wearing a damn mic on camera now. This movie looks like it was made 10 years ago And here I was thinking it was the adaptation of the FANTASTIC videogame... sad. Also - Ruby Rose, that\'s an instant hard pass. Rose Ruby is still kicking butt proving to the world she is the next Jean Claude Van Dame. Morgan Freeman was awesome for donating his appearance to a sub-par movie to increase audience interest. How long before we get an action movie with  Ruby Rose and Queen Latifah teaming up to take on the patriarchy. Dude who keeps casting Ruby Rose in these tired roles no one cares to see. Ever since Ruby Rose did John Wick 2, it seems like every character she’s given to play is just a worsened version of Ares man, the movie these days are getting bad. This is what happens when 10 major production studios are the only way to get funding other than donations. At the time of me watching this , the L/D ratio is 104-161. That’s tuff It\'s like we are watching a movie that started half way and is missing half the rest .I was done five minutes in It\'s an absolute shame. It\'s plain to see how hard Ruby Rose is trying to be the next Angelina Jolie or Charlize Theron in the female action heroine mold...but she so bad at it. And the roles she gets aren\'t helping her play to her strengths. John Wick was a great turn for her, but I think that her work there was elevated by the quality of the movie she was in and the talent involved beside her and behind the camera. (Not to mention the fact that it wasn\'t a speaking role also helped.) But since then, she\'s been on a downward trajectory. The Doorman and SAS were NOT good movies and this seems to be more of the same. I think something big is coming for Ruby Rose. They just want to improve her street cred. If it doesn\'t have Sam Gideon, it ain\'t Vanquish. Ruby Rose and Morgan Freeman need to get themselves better Agents. hollywood glorifying guns but at the same time telling you to give them up.. There are many women with athletic builds who can be cast as BELIEVABLE action heroines. So given the large talent pool that Hollywood has to chose from, why do they pick one of the most frail looking actresses, like Ruby Rose, in that part? I get it if her acting was so convincing, but her line delivery is so wooden, and she can\'t seem to emote at all. Despite how she lacks credibility in the action department, she keeps getting consistent work in the action genre. This is like Michael Cera getting consistently cast as a MMA fighter. 16 mins in and I want to zapp off..But that\'s M.Freeman...!!!\nWatching him, sitting in an automated wheel chair resumes it all..!!! I can only guess that Morgan freeman probably killed Ruby’s daughter and tryna stall her while he hides the body to keep her in the game Who else clicked to just to see if, just maybe, it was gonna be a Platnium game movie starring Sam Gideon in a supersuit with rockets on his butt? Ah, Hollywood again trying to make Ruby Rose happen. At least we know where all of the budget went I love me some Ruby Rose  Got to the grenade part and I was like ""nah"" This was definitely made during Covid and was clearly trying to make something fast and interesting to watch while people were quarantined  \nSorry Ruby, I do love you tho  This looks dumb!  When she tosses the grenade at the guy and he drops it, then yells ""AHH!""  Morgan Freeman is always awesome, but... Just realized this was shot in my hometown and literally NO ONE talked about it The big twist in this movie Morgan Freeman will stand up at the very end and carry all the money/drugs lol, She tosses generic bad guy an unpinned grenade and he just drops it?! Haha wtf no. I give credit to whoever convinced Morgan Freeman to be part of this piece of crap. Ruby Rose ️️️ For a second I thought ""my god""… It\'s so sad to see Morgan Freeman in movies like this( Omg she\'s horrible️they are trying to hard to make her the next big thing she\'s not This is like the whole movie This trailer will be perfect, when it fits a WOMAN ! Is Morgan Freeman actually playing a villain? I can’t tell. P.S. I see Ruby Rose OVERACTING again... Oh yeah, this one\'s going straight to $1 dvds bin. I thought nothing could be worse that covid TILL I SAW THIS MOVIE...  Is ruby rose the queen of making bad movies ? Apart from being in John wick just fighting and not speaking, what else has this woman Been in with any credibility?? I am a simple man, I see Morgan Freeman, I click... Another Morgan Freeman movie let\'s go Bruh.. ruby rose is prolly one of the most unbelievable actresses  alive. Her acting skill are so trash. Batwoman was so bad. No one can save her career not even a god like morgan! I\'m surprised she didn\'t quit after just one... This is really difficult to watch,  i mean even the motorbike scenes look like  she\'s riding something with  a top speed of 50 as much as want it to be. I think it looks too much like an empty john wick. I hope it is good but I fear for the worst. They need stop acting like ruby rose is some kind of badass the last couple moves she’s been in and tv show and movies to come out they acting like she’s got some mad fighting skills Even Morgan Freeman couldn\'t save Ruby Rose. Come on Mr.Freeman, do not walk the same path just like Bruce Willis, John Travolta etc. You are way much better than this. is nobody gona mention the part about how the main character is a former drug runner that doesn\'t exactly make me want to route for her prosperity especially since in these types of generic movies the hero always gets away with everything in the end Great actor When the trailer doesn\'t help the movie.  Clicked the trailer for Morgan, decided it wasn\'t worth my time after seeing Ruby is the lead. NEXT! At some point Hollywood needs to realise that ruby rose just cannot act. And has the charisma of a plank of wood SHE IS BACK - HARDER THAN EVER! ... Sinead O\'connor !!! xD Honestly ist just me or there really trying hard to push this girl as a action so hard even know all her tv show and moviews bomb Why is this so cheesy? I was waiting for it to turn into a Taco Bell commercial. The daughter was nacho fries all along. Dont ecpect much from a movie when they didnt make an effort to make a good trailer Me: Sees IMDB rating 2.4.    Also me: I have to watch the trailer Why did that grenade explosion not move those 2 cars? C’mon...who tricked Morgan Freeman into making this??!! You all realize this girl almost killed John Wick ? Stop trying to make Ruby Rose happen!  Ruby rose...  I’ll pass, Looks terrible.... I feel bad for Morgan Freeman It looks ok to me . There will never be a another Geena Davis as what she did in Last Kiss Goodnight. I feel so many movies try to copy that style of grit and fierceness.  This is another failed attempt Ruby Rose makes Gina Carano look like Meryl Streep. Guy gets handed a grenade to his hands\nOh yea lets drop it so we can die of stupidity What bigwig in Hollywood does Ruby Rose have incriminating photos of that she gets to keep making horrible movies...? from Shawshank Redemption to this....how low Morgan Freeman has fallen Who else thought of the Vanquish videogame first when you saw the thumbnail. Is this a new CW show? The trailer is awful, like it was edited by 10-year-old. Not even Morgan Freeman makes me want to watch this. Is the only good movie with Ruby Rose ""John Wick: Chapter Two""? was hoping for the game Ruby: This motorcycle drives fast......when it fits a woman\n\nI think I found were Kate Kane went. This looks absolutely pathetic. The Mango Pepsi AD before this trailer had a higher budget and a better script. Why do they keep trying to sell us Ruby Rose as some kind of badass action chick? Just stop it already. Ruby Rose is a joke of an actress. Is she going to overpower 200lb men again? Yeah hard pass she can’t carry anything not even a terrible show. Colorama os créditos no início do filme This is to john wick what DC is to Marvel The GOAT  Someday they need to have Ruby Rose and Kristen Stewart as sisters in a movie where they can\'t talk. It should be called Bad Facial Expressions. Well.... I\'m glad i don\'t see a Bt Wman suit in this.. might b watchable 0:30 \n""where is she?""\n""it\'s been seven hours and fifteen days.."" Ruby, it’s too early. Lay low for a couple of years and then try to make a comeback. I’ll still dislike you, but do that. This trailer seems ok until there is a scene of explosion from a grenade which is so poorly executed, then those home made video quality sub-titles came out. Why does this look like a ‘The Bone Collector’ remake? They really keep trying to make her into an action star huh The production looks cheap\nedits looks cheap \nDon’t make make action movies If you don’t have the budget for it Does RR have an accent in this or not? This is looking like a dog\'s breakfast in a blender. Waiting for the comments saying ""Ruby Rose overpower heavy men""\nMeanwhile Scarlet Johannson smaller than ruby rose does the same and it\'s fine to everyone. Any one know the name of the song from this trailer? They had Morgan Freeman for one full day only to film this. Another flop from Ruby Rose. Good job, Hollywood. The title of the movie should be Stop.. as in Stop.. Morgan Freeman\'s too good for this I have to repet this comment : I have no problem with female action stars if they are believable (example: Charlize Theron in Atomic Blonde and Mad Max Fury Road), but can Hollywood please stop trying to make a 90-pound 5 ft tall Ruby Rose an action star?  It\'s laughable Only clicked as I saw Morgan freeman in the thumbnail. Clicked off video when I saw Ruby rose. For a moment I thought it was about the game Vanquish...silly of me to think that, still disappointed though... Morgan taking any money nowadays  I can’t hate I would have to bro  I want to see Miss Ruby Rose as a Marvel or Dc character . Ruby Rose. By far, one of the worst actresses I’ve ever seen. Okay I thought I was the only one who thought this looked terrible until I read the comments lol Morgan Freeman didn\'t want to do the movie, so he said he\'d only sit in the chair and not even remove his earrings. When will stop forcing Ruby Rose on the world ? We\'ve been through enough The movie should have been titled - \'The Girl On A Motorcycle\' the like to dislike ratio though Why so many dislikes? This looks like a VUDU original movie. Someone doing this on purpose to piss people off? 1:07 anybody know what song that is? Directed by Steven Seagal. Alright Morgan Freeman! Oh Ruby Rose..Nevermind.. Thought jt would have been that platinum TPS game Did he just say scumbags ? As soon as I saw ruby rose that’s a no for me Ruby thinking she can next John wick lol!!! It\'s official then freeman is going up against Bruce Willis for the B movie award of the year so sad to see Is that VHS movie from 90\'s? This looks like a 2000 movie trailer. read some comments during the 15 second, unskipable ad (thanks YT) and decided not to even watch the trailer lol Morgan freeman’s fee didn’t allow them to hire another good actor for this movie Does Hollywood truly believe an anorexic woman could do any of this? At least find an actress with muscles.\nOh right, they fired one recently... When i saw ruby rose , my testosterone level down 70% I dont even know where to start. This movie is bad. I just wanted it to be over. lol she was only good in John wick for obvious reasons The talent of Ruby Rose makes me yawn, sadly. I logged into Youtube just to say that I am at peace today, knowing that I\'m not the only one who hates Ruby Rose. And that\'s coming from a fellow Aussie. She can\'t act. Logged in also to click thumbs up on all these other comments dissing on Rose. She\'s as charismatic as lawn clippings, stop casting her. Im not watching this solely because ruby rose is in it... .. She should have stayed as Batwoman I\'m bankrupt after producing this movie Oh god, it´s batwoman. She left Batman women for this? she gon regret it lol Is morgan turning into Bruce Willis!? :( I\'d rather shove that nicolas cage movie down my eyes In action movie 250gm ruby rose kick asses of more than 100kg guys easily, wtf Overrated.. why does she keep coming back as this action-heroine and keep ruining movies..? She needs to learn her stuff from the leagues of Charlize Theron and so on.. Ruby Rose just cant catch a break. Cheeesus. Ah, so that\'s where she\'d (Ruby Rose) been at??!!!  Did they use all the budget casting Freeman? how many chances they going to give RR? Can we all agree that Ruby is beautiful and talented but not an actress? Support maybe, her role in Resident Evil was decent, but she’s not a lead. Couldn’t even do Batwoman on the CW… Taco Bell vibes. How much is Harley Davidson paying for this Livewire commercial? oooh Mr. Freeman...nooooo! You just joined CW movies No more stops. Beat it she has high acting skills but always get the worst scripts so underrated how does she still get work... im 40 mins into the movie and im mad how  bad it is She looks like Rupert Friend in Agent 47 lol Huge flop incoming! so .......... we have a john wick equivalent hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm nice Never mind the 10 minutes it took the movie to start,.....I have no Idea why there are credits at the end if your gonna roll them before the movie, but the cinematics and photography were just awful. I had to quit watching it I started to feel sick. sucks too, I love Morgan Freeman I just couldn\'t sit threw it. Ruby Rose? PASS ! Frankly I only care to find the song in the trailer...does anyone know?! This movie is dead before being out in the cinema. lol What is this? My ten year-old sister could beat up Ruby Rose. 0:18 “Ripley from Alien 3!” 3/10 wish you could actually hear the motorcycle What studio is paying for this? color grade is enough to judge your film future This deserves an overpowering thumbs down Man, Ruby Rose does not shine as a lead role. She really needs to stick to side characters. looks regrettable why does 1080p look like 360p? I’m sorry but I can’t take ruby rose ( espically with a buzz cut) seriously in any film as the main character These days Action movies are not fun any more Omg this is terrible ️ This just looked like a bad generic TV series Should of called it 5 Stops tbh Looks like a low budget film the trailer already lost me with pointless dialogue and over use of action I still don’t know wtf going on Batman and oracle?  Nice Batgirl with a gun... lame!!! Man that dislike button tho lol I’d rather play vanquish by platinum games Ruby, Go home! Hey that GIRL ROSE is in this the mean LADY from John wick Is he not Alfred ? Morgan Freeman, ok, Title is a let down as this is not from the videogame of the same name.  Pass. Lucious meets batwoman ;) Dear Hollywood, please stop trying to make Ruby Rose happen. I see ruby rose and I say no So ruby cant be batwoman anymote bcuz of her body was taking too much damage for stunts but can do this movie yea ok This movie is looking too basic action cliche, well i\'m not watching it. Let\'s do this!!   Wait... hmmm. This is the price of the death of cinemas? Lots of bad movies? Quantity over quality? its like a very low buget chick john wick lol I was watching it and....... I left!!! What did he just said at 1:13? Looks LOW Budget, Specially when the Grenade went off. Lawdy. Even by covid standards this one is bad. Looks like low budget action movie. Was the movie any good ? So, this is what Kate Kane has been doing. How does this hack keep getting movie roles??  Ruby Rose is terrible ah, not woke batman again! She didnt look scary or threeatening at all my god being bold dont make u a dude mate Why is she so focused on action movies they are not her strong point and very shallow characters she plays and generic roles  Pure cheese  I don\'t see rocket propeled sliding mech action\n0/10 worst videogame adaptation\n\n10/10 because Morgan Freeman Hard pass...she just does not look the part, no matter all the sympathetic lighting, the slo-mo effects, close in camera stunt shots, even the haircut!...Its just not believable seeing her stilted-stiff and un-athletic performance even in that two minute trailer .... get someone believable for the role! That lady is old news, she needs to give it up, she failed at batwoman & clearly failed in this. How many movies are in this? This is the movie she got hurt on and blamed it on the batwoman production cause she wasn\'t insured I don’t know if it’s the Gillette ad of a bald head women or the trailer, but now I’m sad. Ruby rose is too beautiful.\nRuby rose is too bad for being actress. That\'s all We get it Ruby’s cute but she ain’t a action star... This movie should be played in prison cells for politicians. whats the background song? In 10 sec i click back! Sorry Mr. Freeman, love your work, but this looks like junk. Morgan Freeman. Must be good, right? Wrong. \'Gone in 60 Seconds\' but somehow worse What’s the song ?! Yes I do know who she is... Somebody No-one cares to see... I would rather watch paint dry Is Morgan freeman that low on cash? Female Jason Statham. One of the greatest actors and one of the worst actresses. Who did that casting ? Ruby Rose.. hard pass. why do they always use fake motorbike sounds that do not fit the engine ? Cheapo all around - I thought Batwoman got into cinemas. Lmfao Lionsgate? I remember when they made decent films using unknown actors. Now we get this steaming pile of excrement using an actor on the verge of retirement who\'s clearly only there for a paycheck and the one expression actress Wuby Wose. Hang it up Lionsgate before you\'re on the list of studios with more bad movies than good. I used to get excited when I seen that Lionsgate logo at the beginning of a movie, now it has the similar effect on me as the Netflix logo before a film  What the?! Oh hell naw. Cast a woman who knows she\'s a woman or get bent. Nepotism in Hollywood is getting bad. Otra película sobre el ""empoderamiento femenino"" Mr.Freeman do need money? So Hollywood now has a female Bruce Willis. How does this girl have a career? Only tolerable in Wick 2 because she didn\'t say anything. So, this is a fantasy movie. 90 lb Batwhamen\'s aint\' gonna do this. AND STOP using weird aspect-ratios !!! Morgan. WHY?????!!!!! These Comments...Hilarious!!! April 23 I didn’t hear a peep about this! That’s a guy or girl it’s been hard to figure out lately Morgan Freeman must have some bills to pay, this crap movie has got to be just a paycheck for him. Did they learn nothing from Bat  woman Hey ruby rose making waves!!! Why Freeman? You are better than this im confused, so morgan freeman had some people kidnap the kid and is using ruby to take gangsta\'s money? Drugs in 60 Seconds. Ruby Rose? Hard nope People please explain it to my dumb simple brain. WHEN, WHERE and WHY did quality movies go to die? Is it just because the money went more and more towards series and tv shows resulting movies went to garbage? Man i wish i was born around 30 years earlier that way i could go to the movies and watch every single great movies from around 70\' to 2005. Anyone agree movies started their dimise around 2005? jane wick Look like sequel of movie doorman BATWOMAN reboot ? Ha ha ha ha\nMore Hollywood dumpster fires is she High this entire movie?  Your eyes aren\'t supposed to be that dilated. Stop trying to make ruby rose happen. Omg she an icon for LGBTQ to z.\nWhy should that matter, she\'s a horrible actor? ""People dont like her movies cuz they\'re homophobic.""\nNo honey, just not a fan!  \nNot homophobic, I love me someone Neil Patrick Harris! Yet again a able body actor playing a disabled part. Worst movie ever  I couldn’t believe my eyes  A100 pound woman beating on toxic men lol this is so woke this movie is a blunder it\'s gonna be poor writing Morgan what did you go to do? One of the best actor in the world is acting with one of the worst actor in the world. In most of the trailer she was just riding motorcycle  WTF. L A M E Crappy movie after crappy movie... Ruby\'s already falling in the trap of being a typecasted actor, basically a one trick pony... I\'d rather read books now than watch any of the crap coming out these days... Why There is Too Many Dislikes? Who?? Who keeps giving these 90lb skinny women roles of ""badass"" fighters/action stars? Like how many of these movies have they made and how many have been complete and utter flops? Guess Hollywood is a different kinda stupid. Is that Ruby Rose or is it the bad British guy from Deadpool? This looks.....atrocious. Made to look even worse by the addition of Ruby Rose. Stop forcing her on us, she ain\'t gonna happen. Jane Wick ? Platinium games film adaptation ? I love Morgan Freeman, but I\'ll never watch this crap. Just like I love Jean Reno, but I\'ve never watch The Doorman. Ruby Rose sucks, that\'s it, she\'s a bad actress. Period. Couldn\'t tolerate it more than 1 minute despite of Freeman...had to stop it and leave a dislike, disappointed  John Wickwoman? This looks truly awful That is a woman or a man? I\'m 43 years old ,I have never seen a movie more idiot then this ,a movie made for goats,waching it it\'s offensive as a human being considered that it\'s Mr Morgan playing\nTake a left \nTake a right  Looks pretty lame. Sorry Mr. Freeman, you deserve better than this. Thought you would have learned your lesson from Hard Rain. :(\nI will probably start calling you Morgan Free-money, since you just cashed in the easiest paycheck of your life No to Ruby I get that Ruby rose is a bed actress but Morgan Freeman like come on So sad. Morgan reaches Trash Level. This movie was horrible. I turned it off after 25 minutes and I really tried giving it a chance On the real though. This stuff is not built for women in real life. It\'s like someone acting what they wish they\'d be but will never be. It\'s not sexism, it\'s reality.

Space Jam Ã¢ÂÂ A New Legacy,"['olXYZOsXw_o', 'ADo0ULPJbuo', 'hcesHoSjVZw', 'HR-WxNVLZhQ', 'UTUR_HvkiNc']","['Space Jam Ã¢Â\x80Â\x93 A New Legacy Is it just me or does the new Space Jam feel like a basketball themed Ready Player One movie. Imagine if this was with KD instead of Lebron and KD\'s like ""I gotta do what\'s best for me"" and then joins the enemy team lmao I actually understand why this movie was delayed for so long now. They were tirelessly pumping money into acting lessons for Lebron to absolutely no avail. This was such a good movie! 10/10 would watch again A movie about a kid getting blackmailed, but in order to get him back they have to play a game of basketball? Just what I needed in my life A movie that never needed a Sequel. The music, the era... timeless. you cant copy that or make it even better. I guess I\'ll be jamming out in space. 2:13 I love the fact that King Kong is just chilling and watching the game like everyone else instead of rampaging through the crowd. 😂 It honestly doesn’t look bad, like we all had the highest expectations and it looks pretty dope. Better than I expected tbh, would be perfect if there was an MJ cameo too 1:40 - 2:08\nThis gives me chills to the max and i dont know why Is it just me or I love it when they say “🎶Welcome to the space jam🎶” Was really looking forward to this, just turns out to be one giant commercial, completely soulless compared to the first. This movie is a excuse for Warner Bros to finally use all the characters and universes they own and just put it into a movie. AND I LOVE IT I can\'t wait for Space Jam: A New Legacy to come out, since I loved the first Space Jam movie from 1996 so much! :D The team that  did the trailer music and syncing is doing a great job This vibe on this one is really awsome! cool effects and colors. 1:33 to 1:51 is my favorite part of the whole trailer! The original space jam is the first movie I have the earliest memories of and my parents played it for me almost every day, so this new movie coming out was very nostalgic for me and I just watched it tonight and I enjoyed every minute of it,  very funny. Hope to see an MJ cameo 🤞 Wow I can\'t believe this they made the Looney Tunes come alive 25 years later this seems a perfect sequel to the first film I\'m loving this new semi animated theme 😍👍🏻 Lebron: ""where\'s my son?""\nDon cheadle brings out his son \n""boom you lookin\' for this!"" It will be the greatest scene of all time \nIf they have Michael Jordan Come Out To Help Lebron & Tune Squad. & the original “SpaceJam” song starts playing while he walks out 1:05 I like how traditional animation is coming back to theatres Im overdosing on goosebumps, too much nostalgia, I can\'t I can\'t 😭😭😭 I’m getting chills right now. I want to watch this movie Even LJ was hopping to see MJ to save his game. There’s gonna be more adults watching this than there is kids lol 😂 Now I\'m debating whether the movie\'s gonna be good or just relying on nostalgia This movie\'s going to have a lot of pop culture references like games and movies This film is basically the equivalent of Warner Bros throwing a Comic Con with a basketball game randomly in the middle. I\'m usually critical of sequels/reboots, but this genuinely looks really good. I can\'t wait to watch it. I came across so many reviews of this movie, most people seemed to dislike the movie because it had LeBron James, but it\'s like everyone is forgetting he isn\'t the only character, a lot of other people played just as important roles  or contributed to the making of this movie and I feel it\'s ignorant and one side minded to completely discredit an entire 2hr movie simply because you aren\'t a fan of the main character. Everyone seems to be a pro or critic on everything until the roles are reversed... I wonder if Michael Jordan would see the sequel, it\'s like Infinity War and Endgame But Basketball!!! ""we need to assemble an elite team""- LeGM 2021. Gave my goosebumps Ahhh my childhood!! Definitely watching this ❤️ This movie is to inspire the kids of the next Generation.. I took my son To Watch this and he loved it, and so did I . Never, in a million years, would I think space jam would get a sequel Just saw the movie and I loved the vfx and the animation hopefully there can be a space jam 3 Michael Jordan is definitely gonna be taking this personally. Coming back to see this for the first time since watching it a bunch of times Day 1...\n\nYeah. I\'m still hyped for this. We’re back to SLAM!!! Welcome back to the JAM!!! I think it will be a great movie honestly I mean after all you can\'t really compare it to the original because it has two different story lines which is dope but it\'s true what they say some people just can\'t accept the fact that there\'s nothing wrong with being different everybody following the same trends and yall don\'t even know it just sit back be grateful and enjoy seeing lebron and the looney tunes on the big screen together 💯 This movie was great, so good. I cracked up & really enjoyed it. Best space jam movie by far! I just finished watching it and it it’s amazing it’s fun entertaining and ur whole family can watch it I loved looking around finding all these Easter eggs and all of these amazing Wonder bros characters I feel it would be cool a movie going threw all the worlds shown Looks like a fun movie. Can\'t wait to see it! I think we can all agree that every kid that grew up watching Looney Tunes are either teens or grown ups now.\nPlease bring back the Looney Tunes show. 🥺\nWe love the adult theme that the show has and i’m pretty sure most of us are willing to pay to watch it. Please consider bringing it back. 🙏🏻 After the whole thing is done I think he’s going to get a sprite cranberry. The team that did the trailer music and syncing is doing a great job So we\'re not just gonna talk about the Grandma that actually kicked a ball This movie is really good y’all. Next level animation. Lebron killed it. Loved the father-son storyline. Don Cheadle was great too as the villain. Highly recommend you take your kids to watch this movie. You won’t regret it 😎 I am so excited for this movie! it is going to be awesome! Honestly I just watched this movie and I\'ve gotta say I loved it. it was so much fun and payed homage to the original Space Jam in parts while remaining current for the new generation. \nLebron is no worse of an actor than MJ was and did really well. I didn\'t think they could pull off a Space Jam sequel but they did and it rocks! This makes me thirstier for another TRON sequel. Well, ik what I’m gonna binge watch this summer, I’ll watch the first movie first, then jump into this one, time to get into the jam again!!! ✊ I\'m so glad they included WNBA players in the new Monstars. Everybody recognizes them and they are very good at basketball. Definitely on the same level as AD, Dame and Klay. The most important thing in a movie is that its woke. The Space Jam song in the background gave me nostalgic chills...as any unnecessary movie sequel that came out like, twenty years after the original trailer does. I just wish it was actually in the movie. Then I would have had MORE nostalgia. Looking at lebron in an elevator doorway makes me realize how tall the NBA really is For alll the negative comments below I disagree. Went to the cinema with my 4 year old son and enjoyed every minute of it. Can\'t believe I was his age watching the original ❤️ nostalgia. Love both films now This is the second time Iron Giant had appeared in a crossover movie. Time to make that sequel We\'re very excited for this one ! ❣️❣️ 10 year old me wanted to go in this world This is either going to be okay, or it\'s going to be really, really, really, really damn horrible.\nEither way, I\'m excited. 1:25 this scene right here just makes me miss original loony tunes, man This film was really good and the music in this trailer is awesome 😎 I love this franchise. It\'s the best. Im so excited to watch this movie!:D I wonder if he can go to Westeros and introduced himself as ""King"" James Love the movie and can’t wait for the song to come out Yes, this is for sure the best animated movie!!!😁👍👍👍 This trailer was way better than the movie itself The perfect sequel doesn’t exi- So,\n\nYou\'ve watched Space Jam: A New Legacy and you\'re rewatching the trailers. It feels like ready player one but crowded with TV shows characters OMG Ive never been so excited this just brings me back to my childhood🥰🥰🥰🥰 I wonder if lebron is just going to walk out when they\'re loosing and blame his teammates Eu vi 1x esse filme, e não vejo mais, o antigo sim vejo e tenho gravado ainda em vhs, nostalgia pura, um filme de hj de filho conta o pai, porra Warner nada ave isso. This animation man is phenomenal 👏 to be honest...this movie is awesome in our generation...hoping for a sequel This looks like a ready player one, basketball themed movie i use to love space jam when i was little...a huge basketball fan, used to play basketball, but wasn\'t good at it. I\'m excited to see this Imagine if someone took your son and said ""if you want him back you have to play basketball"" 1:39 the mystery machine (with Scooby himself hanging out the window), one of the dinosaur excavators, amazonian warriors, a spartan warrior, Zorro\n1:41 the iron giant in front of the evil scientist\'s castle\n1:42 Drogon the dragon and Samurai Jack (very briefly seen) Can\'t wait to watch it with my family. This movie was a 8/10 for me, it used amazing effects. Perfect can\'t wait to watch this movie in cinemas! I just watched it at the movies this was so cool!! As a Looney Tunes fan and an aspiring animator, I love that they brought back 2D animation for cinema and gave a plot point for the shift to CGI. It\'s clever. I\'m just glad they didnt do CGI out right. Can\'t wait to see this movie ^^ I so can’t wait to see Space Jam A New Legacy later this year 1:18 I would really want to see a basketball team of LeBron James, SuperMan, Gandalf, King Kong and the Iron Giant I love the editing I wish I can be like LeBron James and his son and bunny’s My daughter was a year old when the first one was released.  I am looking forward to this one. Had a great time, took my three children, wife, in laws, rented a private theatre viewing at AMC and enjoyed the show Everyone: ""it\'s Space Jam or Ready player One?!""\nWarner Bros: ""YES"" Now THIS is what I want to see in movie and show remakes!!! Best of BOTH worlds baby! 2d! 3D! Art from ALL decades! (Yeah the cg looks wonky of course but its WAY better than other stuff films have been giving us lately) This looks awesome. The first one is a classic. 0:01 This is the best trailer ever I have watched it so many times this is one of my fav movies That scene where lola thru it up to bron and they did what lbj and wade did was a masterpiece I ROCKED WITH IT! MADE ME FEEL LIKE THEY ABOUT TO BRING NBA BIG BACK‼️ No aguardo em!!!! 👀🇧🇷🏀🔥 超期待這部 期待20多年了\n\n拜託趕快出怪物奇兵3 還有4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n希望導演和團隊能趕快拍:))) 00:35 Westeros\n00:37 Wizard of Oz\n00:45 Matrix\n01:16 Maltese Falcon Ok I\'m speechless. All I\'m gonna say is I have goosebumps already I’m So Excited For This!!! This trailer is amazing seriously Pretty sick movie, seeing all the different movies they travel into while looking for the other looney characters was pretty sick I just finish watching this movie and I\'m full of goosebumps ❤️❤️❤️(goosebumps in everywhere my teeth, eyes and kidney)😆 The fact that Lola Bunny did the dwyane wade pose when bron was about to dunk is dope as hell Can\'t wait to see this! OMG. Bugs Bunny just got me chills. It\'s been so long. I just watched the whole movie on HBO Max and it\'s Dope as AF! This is going to be one awsome sequel. The most ambitious crossover ever I’ll watch this when it comes to VHS I love how it starts by flying over a billion dollar house and then acts like we\'re supposed to care about his kid. o.O I like the way they made this sequel the resemblance of Ready Player One and The Matrix im going to watch this at the cinema with my mum and my BFF can\'t wait!!! I\'ll only be happy as long as The Warner siblings get a special cameo and some lines THAT WAS AWESOME 👍 I don’t care if there’s no story, this visually looks amazing. I can\'t wait for this! The amount of basketball memes that will come from this movie will be insane If them really be in real life, Im gonna cry alot 😭😭 I will never love this the way I loved the OG but damn am I excited for this I have watch this... I don\'t care people say about this movie.. but I really enjoy this movie, so much fun, great cgi, famous characters, good story and epic. Wow this looks so good,  I had the video of space jam and never brought it on DVD\nI can’t wait for this to come out on Disney or blueray Just watched it at the movie theatre and I liked it! My favourite part was the rap part! I just hope that the 2d animated section of the film lasts more than 5 mins... love 2d animation and there needs to be more of it in feature films Hopefully LaBron does better in this movie than he did in NBA playoffs for the Lakers Can’t wait for this!!! I like the movie.  The message was on point. That senior discount part tho 🤣🤣🤣 that was awesome Granny! THE VISUALS ARE EVERYTHINGGGGGG😭 Looking at the cameos, it explains why this movie was in development for so long Props to Lebron for doing his acting thing 👏🏾 i cant wait to see this! At 2:07 in the far left side of the screen you can see The Mask lifting his hat up but besides that I LOVE this trailer. The original came out when I was 12 and have always enjoyed it, albeit Mike\'s acting was dreadful.\n\n This digital flash Space Jam just takes away the authenticity feel, but... Watched this yesterday, I give it an 8/10 pretty good. I dont have high standards tho lol As a 90\'s baby who grew up on the original I gotta say...... I\'m all for this. They gonna make a game? Looks dope! This is just the secret start of the ""Warner Bros. Cinematic Universe."", Isn\'t it? Mj: Arm stretches to make half court shot\nLebron: Feet stretches to make half court shot Awesome ❤️\nWaiting for the magical movie ❤️😘 I saw this movie over the weekend \n\nI I HAD FUN WITH IT! Jueves 15 de julio de 2021 espere mucho para esta pelicula, y no me desepciona pero la verdad es que esparaba más que un comercial, y se merece mas esta pelicula no solo por encajar a lo nuevo, Warner Brothers, no sean como otras empresas que solo les interesan vender, ustedes son mas que eso, no soy critico pero la verdad nesesita unos arreglos solo para que yo disfrute del regreso de los looney Toones como se debe si se puede. #RestoreSpacejamanewlegacy. Si se Puede 🙃 Trailer looks great. I am waiting for the movie release 🤩👍 So canonically, the Monsterverse ends with Kong watching Lebron and the Looney Tunes play a game of basketball. I actually like this and I\'m kinda excited to see it. Between both of these trailers, I think Granny might end up being the best part of this movie. I Feel Like There\'s More Dislikers, Haters, &amp Despisers Than Adorers, Lovers, &amp Likers On This Movie. I Just Don\'t Get Why. I Love Both Of These Films. Personally I don\'t think they needed a multiverse situation, but I\'ll still give it a shot. Finally I waited for like two years I keep saying when space jam 2 I really want to see it finally it’s here jeez C O M E   O N   A N D   S L A M This looks epic Quite a solid and fun movie, totally different from the first movie so the two movies are impossible to compare, LeBron was good he acted well... Help I love Space Jam so much that I\'m already exploding for this Okay, I should see this on HBO Max, TOTALLY! I’m gonna be honest the movie wasn’t that bad Lebrons acting was interesting but you can’t say the game animation intro was 🔥🔥 look at the edit I made u see I can’t believe Big Chungus lost so much weight for this role And y’all thought there wasn’t gonna be any space jam movies… but psych! They created a sequel! Shout out to Warner Brothers The reason Godzilla attacked Kong is because he didn\'t get an invitation to the Space Jam tournament. i really hope this lives up to space jam. i think space jam is one of those greatest films that should have never been sequeld THIS IS SHOCKINGLY GREAT MOVIE! I was excited about this until the animation changed and it looked like everything other kids show on tv. Ok honest review. Yes I had my doubts about this “oh it’s too corny” “it’s not like the original”  but overall it wasn’t bad at all. If you liked the first Space Jam then you will like this one. You have to understand it’s meant for a certain audience. (kids) so once that factor is gone you’ll enjoy it. It’s worth a watch. Plus spoiler alert.... This trailer is so satisfying to watch omg MJ gonna drop another series on Netflix because of this. I like how they included monsterverse kong in this movie! They should as put a smaller version of legendary godzilla sitting in the stands aswell I miss the original one but if you wanna see a new legacy and have fun you have to forget the original. These movie is insane!i watched it! If they make a Kobe Bryant tribute in this movie I will cry You cant beat the classics. If MJ and Bill Murray make a special cameo on this, I swear I’m going to scream louder than my son! I’m So Exited For This I still can’t get over LeBron James saying, “What in the Matrix hell is this?” xD Good movie love it Granny\'s (Looney Tunes character) voice provided by Candi Milo, best known as the second original voice of Dexter in Dexter\'s Laboratory, originally aired on Cartoon Network way back in mid-90s. Candi Milo took over the voice of Granny from Looney Tunes (since 2017) due to June Foray\'s retirement in 2014 until her death in 2017. Watched the movie with my family. Love the moral! Super cute movie. Bronny looks different in this 🤨 1:25 this scene right here just makes me miss original loony tunes, man Ahh seeing the animated characters again is just precious... That looks sick I ain\'t going to lie This gives SPACE jam a whole new meaning! Love this movie Not only is this a new movie, it introduces the Warner Brothers Multi verse. This means the monster verse could be official in this. Good film but I preferred the original ok special effects was amazing but I didn\'t like it when toons went augmented but apart from that I give it 9 out 10 😊👍 The Space Jam feels like an overcrowded Ready Player One movie. Is Space Jam: A New Legacy going to be put on the VHS (as recordable) or is it going to be put on DVD (fullscreen 4:3)? oh wow, many characters from many universe combine into one, FANTASTIC I actually enjoyed the movie. It wasn\'t the best, but keep in mind, the first was no masterpiece. I\'m 20 and have watched both. Y\'all just blinded by nostalgia the goosebumps moment is you can watch your childhood movie again:( This trailer killed it when it came out Just giving us both the classic art style for nostalgia and new-gen is cool af. What\'s clever here, in the first movie the tunes dealt with beings from outer space.  Here it\'s a battle within CYBER space. I honestly don\'t think this will be anything more than nostalgia bait. 1:34 to 2:13 HYPE OVERLOAD! i’m still upset that pepe le pew won’t be in here but i’m still hyped for this movie This is only a trailer but I feel it this is gonna be LIT 🔥 Never thought I’d see King Kong & the Iron Giant in the same movie. Twice. Wow, that looks dope! Michael Jordan better make an appearance by the end of this movie!! Would love to see the Looney Tunes reaction after seeing him again Can\'t wait to see it I saw this in cinemas yesterday and it’s actually good!! I got to be honest, the Harry Potter theme gave me goosebumps! Pretty incredible special effects. Just look at how they fixed LeBron\'s hairline. Lookin\' like a double-wide surprise. God damn! This little rabbit\'s hoppin\' down the ol\' bunny trail. Never in a million years did I think they’d make another Space Jam. \n\nI ain’t even mad. Finally a movie with lebron as the Main actor. Cant wait to watch this movie! 🔝2️⃣3️⃣👍 I love it it is amazing Me and my family are gonna watch it now Marvel: “Finally. A worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary!” Watched this yesterday it was awesome 😎 A movie that\'s classic 2D animation and modern 3D animation at the same time? Already excited! Space Jam 2 looks like it might just be the “TRUE”greatest crossover of all time (looking at you, Endgame) Thank you Zack for giving us a great wonder woman There were parts of this movie I liked, but you can never replace the original. First one was better. BRO seeing The Iron Giant at 1:40 makes me so happy, all the other characters too, I can\'t wait to watch this seeing how much the animation has changed since the og space jam is just- wow Us 90s kids can think what we want, but the animation looks incredible. The graphics are amazing Literally this does set up the multiverse which everything that Warner Bros has created for many years. I feel like I\'m the only person in this world that actually likes this movie Good qualities: It\'s nutty, 2D animation is back, and the 1st replacement for Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny is back. This movie just feels like a basketball themed Ready Player One movie Man this makes me so hyped up. “Where’s Dom?”\n\nThere’s no Dom here, only FAMILY. All the Characters I could see:\n\n0:35 Westeros-GoT\n\n0:37 Wizard of Oz\n\n1:21 Bugs wearing Marvin’s Helmet It had been almost 25 yrs to wait Space Jam 2. But now, Space Jam is back. Yes!😃🏀 I chuckled when Yosemite Sam was shooting the basket ball with his pistols.  That\'s about it. I love This movie 🤩 After 25 year finally have another space jam Just now finish watch and damnn this movie is fireeee❤💥 That Lola Bunny reference to Dwayne Wade was slick lol If you make a sequel, make it a good one The remix is a different feel and this movie is a different vibe ready player one vibes! Warner brothers: do you guys want another space jam?\nEveryone: no\nWarner brothers: here you go. Also remember that we own all these other things? Also this has nothing to do with the original I\'m fixing to run my mouth about this movie for the rest of my entire life. I\'m about to see the movie with  my friend so this trailer is amazing It\'s like if Tron, Ready Player One and Looney Tunes had a baby and that baby was raised by basketball The animation of the looney tunes from the 96\'s version seemed better than this colored-up glow of a version. how many characters you want in this movie?\nWB : yes. I might get to see this tomorrow! I cannot wait to see this When I heard the song day welcome to the space i got flashbacks is of my childhood listening to the space jam CD  theme on my walkman i still have the CD it\'s fire Technically this is the biggest crossover in history Well tbh, the first space jam was ridiculous too, and this movie does look pretty cool to watch. Should\'ve made Godzilla and Kong have a 1 on 1 game of basketball. Can’t wait to see the movie today at the movie theaters with my two cousins Devin Booker sends his regards\nJokic would be great choice for third part! Lebron dropped 1000+ points on 5 shots and Jordan only dropped 44 on 22. There are levels to this, this is why LeBron’s the goat🐐 I feel like juice wrld would’ve had some part in one song for this movie and it would’ve been epic I saw it at the cinemas and it was awesome “How many cameos do you want?”\n“Yes.” Incredible, Authent🔥c and Extraordinary 😎 Just one word: WOW! I think 2 looks empressive and funny to me, at the end of the day it\'s a feel good, kiddie movie that isn\'t suppose to be taken seriously by adults who grew up through the 90s one. So they gonna go into this new version with a critical, over analytical adult mindset when there\'s no need to be🙄 just enjoy the film for what it is. When I saw the Iron Giant I cried.\nNot another re-run. Not another re-run!\nI don\'t want to go outside! This movie was the bomb !! Not gon lie, I thought I was gonna be disappointed but I actually think this will be re-watchable just like SpaceJam 1 When we kids are grown up a new space jam will come out\U0001f972 I was kind of hoping they would have someone from the MonStars on the Looney Tunes team since they became Looney Tunes after the first movie. Would have been cool to see them return. Hopefully it\'s a surprise cameo. 這是屬於大家的童年\n\n還有傳奇吃蘿蔔的可愛兔寶寶 \n\n1996年的第一集真的不斷重複看\n\n希望能趕快加快多拍:)))))))))))) good to see traditional hand draw 2D art back This movie still can\'t beat the original but I liked it This is what Ready Player One could’ve been if the stuck to the book. Just watch this on HBO max it was good I don’t know what these haters are talking about  had a lot of funny parts also, put some respect on king James So many childhood cartoon characters in here. Oh the nostalgia... Feel like he’s gonna make one 3-pointer for then go down and grab his knee five minutes into the game. I Love Lebron James because he\'s a cool nba player and he\'s my dad\'s favorite! He\'s also really great at acting in that movie JUST BOUGHT TICKETS TO THE CINAMA IM GOING TO WATCH IT TMR AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! Very much appreciated if they bring back Pepe Le Pew and MJ. Im sure the Oscar will choose Lebron for Best actor in a drama. Good funny movie, bad spots but definitely worth a watch MJ after watching the trailer: It became personal Might be the single greatest advert for hbomax ever! The other place has some big licences but look at the amount and variety just in one 2min trailer Wow, that\'s an interesting fusion of mixed media on many levels. Live action, 2-D, and 3-D plus some good humor tossed in. I\'m getting some Ready Player One vibes with all of the references shoved in all at once but that\'s just nitpicky. Choice in music is a little... meh... though when the actual movie is released then we can judge it. Bravo on pulling this out of production hell. It\'s been shelved almost as long as the remake of Spawn (1997). Rlly want this to come out in DVD I love this sequel John: it\'s  like ready: player one combined with kingdom hearts That scene with Kong, the Hanna-Barbera characters and so on is similar to Disney’s Wreck It Ralph 2 Oh My Disney scene in which they showed their properties and its very pleasing. Finally Warner Bros is acknowledging their full potential and I’m excited. Bring them on. 1:40 This is like the portal scene from avengers but just even more cross overs from everyone\'s childhood. Fun Fact: Everything owned by Warner Bros is going to be portrayed in this film which is pretty lit because it\'s like a anniversary. This is a movie that\'s REALLY WORTHY of seeing in the cinema, if there\'s even one left... love it how lola pose as d wade !! That a very good trailer looking good and funny can wait Just watched this movie and it was amazing OMG 😱 Space Jam A New Legacy! Granny was a cheerleader in the first Space Jam, now she’s playing for the Tune Squad with LeBron James. this is literally just a ""ok heres some more space jam, we\'re just gonna shove in some new stuff to make it look interesting so deal with it lol"" moment and i couldn\'t be happier As soon as I saw Don Cheadle I knew this was going to be a good movie. I came here after I saw the 4.3 rating of the movie on IMDB expecting a lot of dislikes for the trailer but apparently not. I didn\'t watch it yet but my question for those who\'ve watched it, why it got such a bad rating? 👑 Honestly It was Enjoyable!!😂😄🙏💪 My favorite part when all the characters the Warner Brother characters come to Space Jam Bronny and Bryce watching some random kid calling lebron dad for an hour straight: 😢😔 I watched this movie once on HBO Max, and I can tell you for sure that the movie didn\'t have as much originality or imagination in its animation and storytelling as the first one did. Saw the movie it ended it with Lebron\'s signature move... a  shot with no travelling call I love looney tunes 🙌 Oh this looks a lot of fun, I loved the original which OMG!!! is it really over 20+ years ago but after with all the lockdown madness this I think is the kinda movie we all need perhaps Not bad, but I\'m more for the Michael Jordan film. You can\'t beat original classic quality film. It’s so crazy to see how much cgi has changed through the years 2021 coming up with banger movies so far Jordan after watching the trailer, ""and I took that personally"" Am hella exited bro this is going to be dope These players and many players are unique and great ^^ I already watch this movie, this is a cool movie omg These players and many players are unique and great ^^ 0:28 I just wanna positively thank lebron cause he actually got me saying that on tiktok lol Kong went to chill and play ball after fighting Godzilla. He deserved some time off tbh. Wow the visual and special effects are damn! List of most popular movies featuring the iron giant\n1: Space Jam: A New Legacy\n2: Ready Player One\n999: The Iron Giant I liked the trailer and i want to see the movie Space Jam 2 i wish there were three space jam movies. First with Jordan,second Kobe and third James. just finished the movie and i think the movie is really good Lebron going for the dunk and Lola bunny going like Wade to recreate one of the most famous Lebron posters was a good moment It would be cool if like in the first space jam instead of bill Murray...you have Michael Jordan come down and save LeBron and the tune squad from defeat because LeBron can NO LONGER carry a team on his back anymore and win a Championship, or first round in the playoffs 😂 Thanks to BOOKER and the Suns 1:25 this scene right here just makes me miss original loony tunes, man These new films are what I have been dreaming of for the past 15 years. What if my favourite movie\'s crossed over. I know some people complain about it but come on, have you really never thought about what if scenarios involving your favourite characters like, what if superman and the hulk teamed up and fought Godzilla. That what all these new movies feel like to me, really ambitious but the internet thing is starting to feel  a bit old but hey, at least it\'s not an Isekai. The “clockwork orange” part is the best!!!!\n“Your next”!!!!!! I wanna see myself in space jam a new legacy Marvel: ""Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover""\n\nWB: ""Hold my basketball"" The previous theme song was much better. This movie looks cool though, I will sure watch it. This looks just as ridiculous as it needs to be. wow just wow this is sick and nice this is gonna be an amazing Movie space jam after watching space jam and MJ docs several times I can\'t fight the urge to question the needed a sequel. I love the movie OMG I\'M SO EXCITED 😁😁😁😁 Lebron james deserve an oscar Award We\'ve waited so long for this moment... and it is finally coming. Stay calm everyone. Space Jam 2 trailer is almost here... this is like if ready player one and the new tom and jerry movie had a baby, and decided to invite lebron while they were at it It doesn’t take a wall to make Lebron hit the floor and see tweety...it just takes a poke to the eye 0:31 Best part Besides reminiscing on the first, the only two good things about this movie was seeing the Mon Stars in the stands and the picture of Kobe, which they should have made this when he was alive. May be Rest In Peace The 90s called they want Space Jam back. How many cameos and references do you want?\n\nWarner Bros: yes Клас 👍🔥 жду с нетерпением I just saw the movie and despite what the critics rate it this was a very good family movie.I’ve seen booth space Jam  movies and they are both great animation and had different story lines. Lebrons was  more family oriented with a message about family pains  but family unity and understanding  in the end. Skip Bayliss must really dislike Lebron  to  pan this  really good movie on his sports show. This is so stupid, I love it. the tralir never gets old Welp, wish me luck guys. Ima go watch this movie… Don cheadle being the overlord of their universe is perfect Cant wait to see it. Way to go Lebron. Also the the Lakers will be the lowest seed #7 to win the NBA Finals!!! This is Warner Bros\' answer to Disney\'s Wreck It Ralph 2: each flexing their own huge library of IP\'s. Lebron dunking between the legs in slow mo looked like a 2K highlight for a sec Just watched it, I liked it\nJust don\'t compare to the original and it\'s really good\n(The original sets the bar too high) I really thought people would love this as much as my family did. Nobody said lebron was an actor and who said he was in anyway trying to be like mj. Hints why tge plot is changed up a little. Some kids of this generation havent even seen the 1st one. The effects were bomb and they took so long making this so why hate like its a decent movie for critics, and in my opinion🔥 its a family movie if you dont like it go watch the original then This trailer is missing the classic 90s voice-over and it feels more like it\'s an action-drama movie than a feel good action-comedy Too long. but made me laugh sometimes 6/10 Pretty sure I just watched the whole movie in this trailer Alright not gonna lie was a lil sceptic but this gonna be wild. It would be cool if MJ could do a cameo I Hope Scorpion and Sub-Zero should have cameos in Space Jam 2 as well especially the other Mortal Kombat Characters As someone who mostly cares about the sotry,I actually enjoyed this movie,sure,wasn\'t as good as the og,but I found the enjoyment in it,I ignore the ""CrInGe"" and ""CaSh GrAb"" stuff and actually focus on the story of a movie,and it was,like I said,enjoyable I just wish Kobe was still here to do this movie 1:18 don’t tell me ur teaming with that 😂😂😂 this movie\'s whole appeal is that when you\'re watching it you will go ""i recognize that"" If Kobe Bryant(the Legend) is still alive. .I think he can fit the role very well. 😔 I love the crossover tho Next Team to be on Space Jam is: Timmy Turner, Johnny Sins, Edd, Finn, Blossom, And don\'t forget of course Joe So in the first space jam it was live action Michael Jordan in a cartoon world, but in this one its cartoon LeBron James in a cartoon world, but then he turns back into normal LeBron James and all the looney tunes go CG? Looks good I love that moive! This looks like the ultimate acid trip movie This movie is a major reference bomb Lebron: ""What did you do to my son""\n\nCheadle: ""I turned him into a tree"" Would have been cool if they added modern cartoon network characters here Looks like our hopes were annihilated. Fantastic work, Warner Bros. I don\'t care what people say but I loved this movie. Ngl this might turn out better than I expected! I cannot wait for the epic movie space jam 🤩🔥 All of this wouldn\'t have happened if they would\'ve went to the right floor I can see it now. Toon Squad is down by 2 with 10 seconds left, they inbound the ball to lebron who gets away with a crab-dribble and passes to Bugs Bunny for three and the win. It’s gooooooddddd!!!! Bugs saves lebron’s legacy! Or so they think! Referee called a touch foul against the goon-squad before the shot which means that the three does not count. Lebron is sent to the line for 2 game-tying free throws instead. Lebron bricks the 1st and then misses the 2nd free-throw on purpose. Lebron gets his own rebound steps back for 3 and air balls the final shot!!! It doesnt matter what you take him hostage or anything.... You still have to refer him as KING JAMES Gonna see it TOMORROW I loved the movie but the one thing I couldn’t stand is the amount times the fact that LeBron has to get Dom back is explicitly stated.\n“Get my son back”\n“Get your son back” My friend: endgame was the biggest crossover\n\nMe, an intellectual: yeah, your right This CGI makes me feel soooooo old\nI grew up on the old fashion animation, the loony toons were a part of my earliest childhood memories 大家真的等了很久很久\n\n等了超過20年 等到天荒地老\n\n希望一年可以拍一集\n\n每年我都進戲院支持^^ I’m always here for the Tunes to fight War Machine The trailer gives me chills but the movie will probably give me ills. Ready Player 2 is the sequel we needed Space jam: new legacy\nFanscription:\nA)protaganist (aka sports playing celebrity) should be potrayed as a \nRich guy who loves to spend time with his family and also as a modren day Santa type of guy (aka a person who loves to give gifts to poor and needy) Wasnt expecting to see Don Cheadle as the villain\n\nGotta admit this looks HELLA FUNNN This is actually kinda hype 25 years 25 years since the first space jam came out and now we’re being welcome to the Jam again Bupkus: “Hey Lebron, how’s my boy Zion doing?”  \nLebron, “What?”\nBupkus: “Nevermind...just forget I said anything!”  \nLebron under his breath...”I knew it!” I\'m gonna lose it if the final boss battle is MJ They need to keep the original theme Klay as Wet Fire is a dope ass character concept! Superb Film😍 2:10 Lola pulling the DWade lob is INCREDIBLE! 😬🤟🏾 I just realized bugs was wearing the original Tune Squad jersey while he was turning 3D 2021/05/19 seems like the 2020-2021 version of the Warriors and Cavaliers G7 feeling\n\nFeeling concentrated into a game is not divided\n\nSuperb game between the Warriors and LBJ\'s extra game\n\nBetter than the championship game😃 Looks like ready player one and pixels together 2021/05/19 seems like the 2020-2021 version of the Warriors and Cavaliers G7 feeling\n\nFeeling concentrated into a game is not divided\n\nSuperb game between the Warriors and LBJ\'s extra game\n\nBetter than the championship game😃 WHEN IS THIS COMING!!!  😭😭😭 Dude... MJ must make a Cameo in this film... this really hit my hard, I loved Space Jam. Can\'t wait for this movie to come out! After watching Michael Jorden in the original I would have a very hard time watching this one. I wouldn\'t be surprised if Sesame Street is included in the film and Serververse as well (technically, WarnerMedia doesn\'t really fully own it, but it airs on HBO and HBO Max now). Enjoyed watching Warner Brothers Jam: A Company Legacy!! 2021/05/19 seems like the 2020-2021 version of the Warriors and Cavaliers G7 feeling\nFeeling concentrated into a game is not divided\nSuperb game between the Warriors and LBJ\'s extra game\nBetter than the championship game😃 If only Kobe Bryant was still here. This a movie where Don cheadle would be like “BOOM, you’re looking for this?” If LeBron has 2 twins YoungBron and HeatBron at the finale basketball THAT WOULD BE EPIC “Dad you never let me do my thing, I wanna be a dancer”\n\nGets fucking kidnapped* i\'m just waiting for this like 20 years loll😱😁 Do they ever address the OTHER time it all came down to a looney game of basketball?? I would think Bugs would be like ""hey remember 25 years ago when this happened? What\'d we do then?"" Or does space jam 1 just not exist in this one This is my favorite movie now The films premiere was absolutely great on my opinion, but LeBron James acting was worst to be as a character and the storyline in the opening doesn\'t even retail about basketball as his son who want\'s to go on Camp E3 video games, it\'s not perfect as the original writing with it but the details of the story it\'s not that very unique as before. The CGI and the VFX special effects they did was premilitary out of this world in the making, I\'m very impressed of how they did it to create out a live action. The reference of the film was perfect but it doesn\'t state out as the classic when they had bright ideas of what to make out a great vocal preferences ideas. About Lola bunny being desexualized just makes it worst to the audience seeing her no strength but it was a to defend that this was a kids movie they did, Zendaya did it great making out the voice of Lola that was similar heard as Kristen Wiig from the Looney Tunes Show. As always the film it\'s great, but the story it\'s not as it\'s used to. Warner Bros. need to move on it\'s generation to make out perfect strategies between the producers from what to do. All it\'s great is that this film has grossed out about $13.3 million worldwide from 3,965 theaters by it\'s opening weekend. The Space JAM the Space JAM!!!! The fact that Pennywise is here shows the sheer depth of the cameos they stuffed in here for people to comb through When LeBron was challenged to a game of basketball, he should\'ve said ""You want some of this? You got it."" 1:05 I like how traditional animation is coming back to theatres Looking like a double wide surprise (inhales) GOD DAMN! For a second, they made LeBron shorter than Kevin Hart. Kevin probably saw that as a win. My son just said Michael Jordan is still the goat after watching the first and then this one.... i cried cause it\'s facts. So we’re not going to talk about how King Kong is appearing in two movies this year 😍😍😍😍 this is going to be epic How many MJ references you think there will be? Or maybe none? I love it I watch it today As a hardcore original space jam fan... I can honestly say I look forward to seeing this!! If Kobe was still alive, they should’ve used him and gigi in this movie, and made a space jam 3 with lebron and a whole other Writer of the movie: so how many pop culture characters do you want in this movie?\n\nDirector: Y E S Spoilers: Lebron takes a knee in defiance of the Goon Squad until he realizes they are from China and apologizes profusely\n\nThen the Toon Squad loses in 6 This trailer literally revealed everything about the movie. Lesson #1: Never underestimate old people. Including Granny in the end Infinity War was the most ambitious crossover in history.\nWarner Bros: hold our shield The end 😭💀 This summer, get ready to jam again. They need to make a thumbelina live action please! LeBron: I need to assemble an elite team\nChris Smoove: LeGM BACK AT IT!!! who else is hyped to go see this at the movies when it comes out? I love seeing the animaniacs here! So it seems all of the movies and cartoons from the past years all came together into space jam I love the Toons CGI Models! 1:12...this make me feeling well😍 The Space Jam theme just hits differently LeBron James bless you and your entire family for eternity Amen I would love to see Lola bunny’s name changed to Daisy bunny. Make Daisy look like Bugs but with the same fur as Lola. Space Jam: We Took a Dump On The Legacy. We tried so hard to make Lebron\'s 2 championships look good but, everyone knows it doesn\'t compare to Jordan\'s 6. 😆 There was a lot of cool stuff like flingstones,king kong, and alot more but I going crazy with hype when bugs bunny said,""eh whats up doc?"" I still don\'t think this will top the first one but if Micheal Jordan shows up at the end or something than ill be happy. Just finished watching this movie Not gonna lie, that “shoot the ball” joke hit home hard. This movie will make you laugh and enjoy while watching it and might post on social media that you liked the movie but forget all about it on the next day that you watched the movie. I\'m not hating the movie itself but damn I am 100% sure that this movie is pretty forgettable. ""Bet Will Smith ain\'t gonna deal with this.""\nWill Smith: So that\'s it, huh? We\'re some kind of Space Jam Fantastic using many Ready Player One Easter-Eggs including the Iron Giant and King Kong. I would love to see a live-action/animated cosmic science fiction Duck Dodgers TV-Series, with Daffy Duck (Captain Duck Dodgers/Voice: Eric Bauza), Porky Pig (Eager Young Space Cadet/Voice: Bob Bergen), Marvin Martian (Martian Commander X-2/Voice: Eric Bauza), Queen Tyr\'ahnee (Re-Voice: Tia Carrere) in this very CGI, where we get to witness the show take place at 2350 AD Still say the 1996 version was the best and only one that should never be duplicated. Space Jam 2: A New Legacy Trailer 1 Starts At 4:30 Pm On My Nintendo Switch On Saturday 24th July 2021! I\'m looking forward to it👅✨❤️ 0:54 When your parents sit you at the kids table even though you’re a young adult Fun fact: Space Jam 1 came out when I was 6 years old. Now the sequel is out as my first child is turning 6\n\nFor everyone whos trying to do the math😂 I am a woman born 1990 and my son was born 2015 Первую часть посмотрел лет в 5.. Майкл Джордан 💪🔥🚀 This is going to be the best movie of the year Who else’s fav character is the grandma with the walker 🤣 This film may as well been a trailer for the matrix with the amount of references lol This feels as if it\'s trying to mess up MJ. THE G.O.A.Ts space jam movie. The Ready Player One vibes are off the charts It would be cool if he remembers the first time he went there and was like Oh no not again you guys Aww I was hoping it would stay as old-school animation...but I guess kids would hate that these days. Just like I couldn\'t watch old movies in black and white when I was a kid lol. I get it. It\'s time to pass it on to a new generation x Love ❤️ The Rick and Morty reference in the movie is AMAZING. just imagine that it could\'ve been Kobe instead of LeBron😪 You know with the revival of Animaniacs, they better get featured, even just subtlety, in this movie. Well, The Lego Movies that Legos are my favorite and Space Jam with Looney Tunes: Back in Action that the Tune Squad vs. The Monstars and The Goon Squad in high Basketball game courts are perfect start for the Warner Bros. Marathon. Also it will feature classic Films, Happy Feet films, Cats & Dogs and many more. This will be so awesome, it will make you so looney and so epic. So that\'s what Kong was doing while Godzilla was fighting Ghidorah This is the best movie EVER Regular people: LeBron must be the mc cos he\'s the current best player in the NBA \nBron haters: LeBron must be the mc cos he\'s the best actor in the NBA Was it really that bad? It looks so pretty I want it to be good. 希望華納快點趕快拍續作\n\n讓LBJ跟眾多球星能紛紛怪物奇兵3裡面真人亮相\n\n\n\n真的非常非常喜歡怪物奇兵  The whole time I thought they were going to remix the space jam song and I was very sad after it came out hoping that Michael Jordan faced a cameo in this one it would be crazy 希望華納快點趕快拍續作\n\n讓LBJ跟眾多球星能紛紛怪物奇兵3裡面真人亮相\n\n\n\n真的非常非常喜歡怪物奇兵  1:40 This is like the portal scene from avengers but just even more cross overs from everyone\'s childhood. I want to see that movie This whole trailer, to quote Nathie...\n""Is it just me or does the new Space Jam feel like a basketball themed Ready Player One movie?""\n\nThey be goddamn right, WB really screwed this up big time.... cant wait Wouldn’t it be dope if Shay and Skip took notes during the movie and talked about it on one of their segments as if it were a real thing. it would be great if it stayed 2d Michael Jordan is such an innovator its crazy Did you just call the opposing team Goons? That\'s THEIR word. Hope this is good, but god, I just want a movie that isn\'t a sequel for once. 1:00 LeBron was sky diving into the Tune World. Space Jam 3 Jordan vs. Lebron I 💕 the video....so Amazing Guys, imagine the hype if Michael Jordan made a cameo and the two went one on one! You\'re probably going to have more 30+year olds watching for nostalgia than actual kids haha Everybody Get Up It’s Time To Slam Down We Got A Real Jam Going On Welcome To The Space Jam! KING OF  THE BOX OFFICE💜 That\'s why the OST sounds lit. It\'s from RL Grime. epic! Having grown up watching MJ’s Space Jam, I’m feeling a bit indifferent to this one. At least this generation will have their own, just like us 90s babies, had ours This movie help us to know that MJ is the real GOAT This is one of the most expensive looking movie, I’ve ever scene, along with horror, and other people and things in media. I still can’t believe no ones giving more attention that the voice actor of Lamar from gta 5 was the cop in space jam 2 lmao Here\'s the sad truth: this is the closest thing we\'ll be getting to another Roger Rabbit-type film, besides Ready Player One. Ironically though, I was lucky enough to view a reshowing of Roger Rabbit in theaters last month at a theater that showed old films. 2:23 they literally both touched it with the foot. Can’t help but feel like that’s against the rules Lola doing the iconic D. Wade pose goes so hard I’m guessing in 10 years We’ll have The Disney Princesses helping Fred Savage’s grandson win a Fortnite tournament against Tupac’s - hologram and Deadpool! the lola bunny wink is  one way they will make it through without any hate We all love  👑 James Jordan was so much better, in every sense. Where was the space in this Space Jam? Do I miss it? Should have been virtual jam? Digi Jam? I\'m hoping for a Scorpion cameo in this where he yanks the ball away from Lebron with his classic ""Get over here!"" Hmm. I wonder if old time TV Shows like The Cast of Friends, Big Bang Theory, Murphy Brown, etc and Recording Artists like Rod Stewart, Madonna, Kylie Minogue, etc are also gonna make special cameo appearances in Space Jam 2 as well? Not gonna lie, Ready Player Space Jam looks kind of good. Iron giant about to be unstoppable in the paint😂 chills with the music I am for sure watching this with my sister we both play basketball and woah taht trailer 🏀 Warner bros,thus movie is so EXTREME! I have always wanted to work with you guys when I grow up. I am your number 1 FAN.I even watched the TOM AND JERRY MOIVE.I wish the best for you Warner Bros☺ Music: Welcome to the Space Jam\n\nOld Space Jam music: Come on and SLAM to the JAM This is the most ambitious crossover I’m low-key excited cause I absolutely loved Space Jam but at same this is modern whereas Space Jam was simple as😭 The best part is when Micheal Jordan makes an cameo Good movie 3.5/5 haters gonna hate.. 超級喜歡NBA的\n\n找麥可喬登來客串\n\n雖然喬登年紀大 但是可以找他客串\n\n真心建議華納找喬丹在新拍攝加入企劃^^ first micheal jordan gets his own brand and now lebron gets his own movie, lol Flintstones even made the cut hell yeah 😂🤟🏻 Safe to say this is one of the greatest animated movie disasters of the 2020s. I can\'t believe I\'m saying this, but I am starting to be glad that PePe Le Pew didn\'t have to suffer being in this awful movie in the long run. It would have been an awful way for his character to go.  Did not care for the reviews. I watched this twice and still enjoyed the heck out of it WOW! I CAN\'Tunderstand .i love it space jam meets ready player one with a touch of Scoob= an excuse for more hannah barbera related universe movies in the future. Is this as good as the space jam 1? Michael Jordan when not asked to return for the sequel: ""So I took that personally."" So I noticed in Space Jam: A New Legacy that in the scene where Sylvester spits out Tweety and Speedy Gonzales(Gabriel Iglesias) says “You can smell it” is a little Easter egg referencing the famous Gabriel Iglesias story of when he got pulled over after getting donuts after making an illegal left turn and the cop asks Gabriel if he knew why he was pulling him over and Gabriel says “Cause you could smell it!”. Thought that was so cool that they added that in there! “We need Kong”\n\nKong: Sure, but I gotta watch a basketball game first Most people on here just don’t like Lebron ..if it was Luca doncic with the same role there would be no complaints lol I’ll take any entertainment after what we’ve been through 😤.  Yup, Disney+,  Prime, and others have been my friend. why is everyone hating on this lol just saw the movie and i thought it was great MJ beat the monstars with the fippin\' tune squad, LeBron has to godforsaken Iron Giant on his team! I Love this movie Director: ""How many of our IPs should we feature?""\n\nWarner Bros: ""Yes"" I love soooo much This movie is not another Sponge On The Run disaster that points the finger at COVID-19. It’s a stellar looking phenomenally animated movie. Yeah, some of the logic of when Lebron is a cartoon and when he’s real is kind of off, and honestly I wish they would’ve just thrown out the cartoon Lebron idea and stuck with the Space Jam, real basketball player, and cartoon loonies. But the HD real life looking loonies looked amazing, and took advantage of today’s HDR technology. Fun fact:\n\n\nThis movie is actually a subtle hint to the movie Space Jam featuring Michal Jordan This looks fire I love the movie space jan  legacy If you\'d show me this when I was a kid, I would\'ve had a seizure. Man, People are tripping about this movie. It was fun and entertaining and mainly meant for families! Since when is that not enough?? This will never be as good as the original one 1:18 the only ones you need are Kong and Godzilla, dude. Space jam with Michael Jordan still the best I watch this movie another time and this trailer is still popular Warner Bros: Lebron, we want another space jam movie with you in it. \nLebron: You have to refer to me as the king as much as possible. I just went to the theaters and THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME 👌🍿🍿🍿🍿🏀🏀🏀🛰🛰🎟🎟🌟🌟 Thought this was an April Fool\'s Joke.... My consciousness is at 100% today. The first one is a perfect movie. Let’s see what this has to offer OMG I CAN\'T WAIT TO SEE EVERYTHING ESPECIALLY BUGS AND DAFFY LET\'S GOOOOOOO Waiting on that Lola solo trailer....  Everybody, Get up\nIt\'s time to slam now\nWe got a real jam goin\' down\nWelcome to the Space Jam I was expecting an April Fool’s joke but ended up pleasantly surprised. FINALLY!!!!! Normally, I’m not into trailer teases... but you guys earned this one. Good for you, WB marketing team. Gonna fly like an eagle!!! Spit shine!!! \nFirst one is a CLASSIC. Can’t wait to see what they cook up now I mean it was a “trailer drop” and they delivered I\'d love to see a completely animated Loony Tunes theatrical movie. The animation for Wile E and Roadrunner looks awesome! People have no idea how long I’ve been waiting for this Something that this does give is how good the animation will be for 2D parts I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE WHEN IT COMES OUT!!! Hope they include a remastered space jam theme song  SPACE JAM, O JOGO DO SÉCULO  I like the idea of this teaser. It\'s called a ""Trailer Drop"", released on April Fool\'s Day and it\'s a literally trailer drop.\n\nGreat gag, even though it\'s just an announcement for when the first trailer comes out. Still, can\'t wait till Saturday for the official trailer, an early Easter treat. And for those asking “Where are the Monstars?”\nThis film will not focus on extraterrestrials but will explore a different type of space..... “Cyberspace.”\nI mean the logo is made out of microchips and stuff. I\'m so excited for this movie. I want to see this movie in theaters. Can\'t wait until Saturday.\n"" Everybody get up it\'s time to slam again\nWe got another real jam goin\' down\nWelcome to the Space Jam: A New Legacy Well...they really delivered what the title promissed.\n\nBy the way, I loved the animation lol Omg I laughed so hard when the, for lack of a better term, trailer dropped. It definitely took me back to when I’d watch the looney toones as a kid with my dad on our lunch breaks on Cartoon Network  YAAAAAAAAAY THE TRAILER COMES OUT SATURDAY I CANT WAIT!!!!! The original Space Jam was funny and well animated in my opinion now I hope they make this new one even better. OMG OMG OMG IM SO HYPED!! THE ANIMATION IS SO GOOD!!! Okay. Don’t disappoint me now. The first one is perfect in every way Aww yeah, hyped. Regardless of this being good, or not nothing can be bear the first film. It’s a classic. Yay! So excited for the first trailer for \nSpace Jam: A New Legacy on Saturday! The first one was soo much good and the sequel is gonna be amazing I hope the Monstars will make appearances for Space Jam: A New Legacy.  I wasn\'t expecting this to not be an April Fool\'s joke. See y\'all Saturday Man after making Godzilla Vs Kong almost perfect I bet this sequel to that amazing classic (yes I called it a classic) will hopefully honor Kobe and make a amazing movie I’m so pumped for the movie but I would also like to see a who framed Rodger rabbit 2 Finally after hearing about it since well January, we can finally see the trailer Wb dropping fire every week now Finally! We\'re getting the trailer this Saturday!!! They weren\'t kidding when they said that it was a trailer drop. Who\'s ready for Space Jam: A New Legacy trailer this Saturday?! Good job for working in this and I can\'t wait for the trailer and Saturday when it comes out The Tune Squad has returned to the Space Jam! Oh now THAT is some nice animation Saturday!\nThat\'s 2 days away!!!!\n\nALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN I’ve got Goosebumps Esta parte de mi vida se llama felicidad I knew they\'d do something for April fools. Very looney.  Rest in peace, Kobe. Wow! I\'m so excited for this. This is going to be the next great live action hybrid since Roger Rabbit. Thank you Warner Bros. Me and my mom or looking forward to go see it in the movie theaters I can’t wait for the trailer tomorrow Did any one else noticed how the road runner’s iconic sound has a different pitch??? I’ve waited 20 years for this\n\n\nEdit: OK OK I GET IT IT WAS 25 YEARS AGO I DIDN’T EVEN EXIST 20 YEARS AGO LOL Remind of our childhood ️ What a perfect way to announce a trailer drop. \n\nA literal trailer drop on Wile. E Coyote Finally the trailer will arrive on Saturday This will be a classic 20 years from now ""They said the SnyderVerse would never come again""\n""It has to.""\n\n#RestoreTheSnyderVerse The only April fools joke I’m okay with today Lola bunny\'s hype is real Announces a kids movie\n\n""THIS FILM IS NOT RATED YET, GUYS!! WE SWEAR"" That\'s all I wanted. Teaser for a Trailer. This is only the beginning. Finally a trailer for this. I thought it was an April Fools joke, but okay. I am in to this stuff! Very clever joke. I was expecting to see trailer today but turned out it was hilarious. I can’t wait to see the trailer in this Saturday Can’t wait for this movie They had to kill coyote just to announce the trailer date ...that’s the evilest April fools prank ever I felt like they should have released it on sunday because of Easter and how bugs bunny is a bunny too. Yasss, can\'t waitttttt  Hopefully this is gonna be a good movie WOO HOO!! Can’t wait! Also Happy APRIL FOOLS DAY! man i can nit wait  for this trailer and i hope they gonna use that music from the original movie and remix it man i will be blow on away FINALLY,good animation btw Firstly, that was pretty funny.\nSecondly, I CAN\'T WAIT!\nAnd thirdly, I thought this was an April Fools\' prank. Birthday release!!!! Hell yeah dude! I am hyped for space jam 2 I may personally not like the first Space Jam (Looney Tunes: Back in Action is WAY better) but I have high hopes for this. I\'ve been waiting for this This is a perfect day because Looney Tunes are mostly a part of Saturday Morning Cartoons. Really excited!! The only thing weighing the movie down, is Lola... Otherwise.\n""IT\'S YOUR CHANCE! IT\'S YOUR DANCE! IT\'S THE SPACE JAAMMM!!"" So nostalgic !! Can’t wait! They are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AMAZING  Thank you Zack for giving us a great wonder woman Can\'t wait for tomorrow! April fools joke. Imagine announcing the ZSJL2 today and it is a prank. Legendary OMGGGGGG YESSSSSS!!!!!! I\'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOREVER!!!!!!!! Boa tarde, um belo vídeo maravilhoso. I\'m ready for the Space Jam 2 trailer I\'m very excited about the memes we get from this 20 years from now The 1st one was great I wonder if Lola had a kid now I’m only watching for my Looney Toons ️ still waiting to see if Animaniacs is actually going to be in the movie I hope to hear new songs like the 1996 soundtrack. Legend says he\'s still holding the sign. I have waited for over 2 years for this. Be prepared to cry of joy folks  If we don\'t hear the Space Jam theme we riot Imagine Jordan has a surprise cameo  Unfortunately, there is an increasing probability that the movie will feature a reference to Big Chungus Evvai, I can\'t wait Can we keep this 2D animation as a whole movie? I can not wait to see this movie yeah space jam  This is it, the trailer is coming tomorrow, you OG Space Jam fans better be ready this Saturday! YESSSSSSSSSS FINALLY!!!!!!!!  Anyone else here after receiving that April Fool\'s joke about Zack Snyder\'s Justice League 2 Hello Warner Bros. I wanna email you and tell you about how you can get away with offensive media easily. It seems there have been lots of problems getting things age-appropriate or getting things to be not at all offensive. I personally want you to understand that the way you made your movies back then were not bad in any way. The way you should understand if something is wrong or unacceptable is by hearing the thoughts from the target audience that relates to it. This is a situation a lot of companies are dealing with and I want you to be the one to share it with more people because I think that these companies deserve to get away with much more stuff than wanted. It\'s easy not to get in trouble, all you have to do is find the right person to see it and if the target demographic is offended or horribly influenced, that\'s when you can know to stop. I wanna tell you this because you are my favorite company ever and the best way for you to avoid having to restrict so much is simple and easy. It’s simple to find the people who are meant to watch, play, or see the thing and let them decide if it’s offensive or not. In conclusion, the thing I want you and other companies to understand is that as long as the target audience is offended or horribly influenced, there is no reason for censoring. From one of your best fans: Jack Rodak Wow... This is genius! Imma Watch This Movie On The First Day! Can\'t wait for MJ to get subbed at the end, and hit a clutch game winner.  I’m hyped and I never even saw the first movie. ""This Film is Not Yet Rated""\n\nHmm, what do you guys think?\nRated R? Se for 1º de abril eu taco fogo na produtora Warner Bros  I hope Road Runner has more of a role this time. Two of these characters from that video is going to get their own movie in 2023! NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL A LOONEY APRIL FOOLS GAG WITH A LITERAL TRAILER FALL I have a feeling this movie is going to be good and bad at the same time “Meep meep!”\nAhh! Classic Thank you for the heads up. I will be on the lookout for this trailer so that I may be one of its first comments  #restorethesnyderverse WE WANT THE OLD LOLA BACK A literal trailer drop. I can\'t wait for the preview! It\'s only Side note, but I would love a Smash Bros style game (Platform Fighter) starring Warner Bros. Cartoon characters. Can\'t wait it would be funny if Steph Curry cant even make a free throw when the monsters take his powers This would’ve been a super bowl commercial This was delightful. Oh wow so excited for this ️🇧🇷 Hell it was about time! WHO ELSE HYPED! now that is an Easter Present excellent! original space jam with michael jordan always the best Hype! I wish they making Future Quest movies\nStarring Space Ghost, Jen, Jace, Blip, Birdman, Avenger, \nGalaxy Trio (Vapor Man, Meteor Man, Gravity Girl)\nThe Herculoids (Zok, Tundro, Igoo, Gloop and Gleep) YEAH!!!! So awesome This movie is not yet rated I guess it’s going to be rated r It seemed violent to attack the coyote with a trailer, I vote for the cancellation of the character so as not to offend people with this violence. So this whole movies an april fools joke? Good to know. owowow HELL YEAH... Lokking forward to this...\nand also looking forward to #RestoreTheSnyderverse Man, I love ""literal"" jokes.  Excellent!!! and that was the best April Fool\'s day prank ever!!!\n\nAnd now, a new trailer for ""Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021)"" are Coming this Easter weekend, 2021!!! I hope we can see Pepe le Pew doing his best Already I love this movie (Like Tom and Jerry.). The meep meep from Roadrunner sounds to slow, just that sound alone has put me off this whole movie haha LABron: Featured on Space Jam\nSmoove: As LeGM LEGACY Continues I love Wille E and Roadrunner I thought this was an April fools joke but now I’m hyped  They should bring back Loonatics Unleashed with a 3rd Season or a reboot Loonatics Unleashed (but not like Teen Titans Go and Ben 2016) The “meep meep” sounds like an old recording, like Paul Julian. I like that “You know I’m ballin’ usual like Kobe” ... I really hope this will be a much better improvement than the first movie 20 years ago. Even With LaBron or NBA players who will be ""Actors"" in the movie. I mean they need act In this movie and be players at the same time. That\'s one the reasons why the first film is nostalgic but it was terrible and unfunny. I really hope and believe they need to stick the landing and step it up also learn from their previous movie 20 years later and actually make a GREAT and ACTUALLY FUNNY Movie out of this. I believe so that they will but am a bit nervous. :) Rest in peace Kobe  Oh I’m very excited to see the movie but which animator animated that sneak peek? Çocukluğum... Is this the animation style they\'ll go for the movie, or that CGI one they dropped? I\'m kinda confused. Wow I got here almost instantly If this is the updated 2d animation, then I say \'\'Told you Warner Animation Group has no experience.) Who else is waiting for Conjuring the devil made me do it If only they’d give Pepe a chance We need Pepe Le Pew, we need Pepe Le Pew,\nwe need Pepe Le Pew, we need Pepe Le Pew,\n\nPlease put Pound, Bang, Blanco, Bupkus, Nawt The day has finally come. Hey Scooby-Doo! fans out there, you guys should make SCOOB! The 4-Part Experience!. Long story short; It\'s SCOOB!, but LEAGUES better than the official SCOOB! movie itself in every sense of the word and it\'s in 4 parts, just like Zack Synder\'s Justice League. #WarnerBrosPictures #WarnerAnimationGroup #SCOOB #SCOOBThe4PartExperience They had us at the first half,not gonna lie Space Jam A New Legacy - Teaser 2 Starring Bugs and Daffy  Bring back Pepe!

Without Pepe and Penelope, the film is no longer very exciting  Ok you got me #Aprilfool\nBut not again "" #RestoreTheSnyderVerse "" Ok this was clever and funny. I forgot today was April 1st.

That\'s cool Let\'s gooo  0:03\nCinemaSins: Coyote survives this #Restorethesnyderverse HA!\nTrailer drop(ped on his head)\nNow thats the kind of clever humour i can get behind Hmm. I thought the constant delays, cancelling and the fact that we have had no new movies for almost a fucking year, would have put an end to these stupid trailer teases. Guess I was wrong. Yep, totally a trailer drop ( da dum crash) Give me the ring. No don’t even say nothing just give me the ring.  That looked like Coyote vs. Acme. First, and this seems sick! I hope this isn’t an April fools joke Wokeness, Lebron James and the WNBA, no Pepe le pew, lol this movie is going to blow #RestoreTheSnyderverse #ReleaseTheAyercut Man of Steel 2 Ben Affleck Batman Movies Justice League Zack Snyder 2 3 Movies that beep beep sounded bad...too low pitched...Why?! I may not have watched The Road Runner for over a decade but I still remember how he is supposed to sound. still matrix 4 we want a trailer They took everything from me. #restore the Snyder verse Cool \n#RestoreTheSnyderVerse #ReleaseTheAyerCut \n#RestoreTheSnyderVerse Lebum\n\n#releasethesnyderverse Well great... you got me  WOOO HOOO WOOO HOOO Coooooool #RestoreTheSnyderverse #RestoreTheSnyderverse #RestoreTheSnyderverse #RestoreTheSnyderverse Not thrilled about LeBron James replacing Michael. They should\'ve instead focused on a star athlete from a different sport for the sequel instead of sticking with Basketball especially if MJ is not returning for the sequel.\n\nWhy not instead The Toon Squad recruiting for example Tom Brady (American Football) or Cristiano Ronaldo (World Football, aka Soccer) or maybe even a dream team of Olympic champions like Usian Bolt & Michael Phelps. Let\'s go #restorethepepelepewscene I really thought I was getting pranked. I’m so happy this isnt So a trailer for a trailer?\nOkay...... Thought this was a April fools joke i didnt get this recommended until today so i didnt realise it was an april fools joke Restore the snyderverse YEEEEEEAAAAAH #Restorethesnyderverse Eso fue todo ️️️️ #RestoreTheSnyderVerse ""They won’t believe you because you’re a man."" -Amber Heard wont be as good as the Michael Jordan 1 #restorethesynderverse Sh!t really in 2 days god damn it Warner bros  MJ better be back.

Thunder Force,"['qnx6-YLXFwg', '9wTVKzgHzE8', 'kJa8b8Zplv4', 'HMyWw2GXmsU', 'IOlY6dR8PAE']","['Thunder Force I love how Melissa\'s husband is almost always in her movies doing one small thing or another What I love about this is that Melissa & Octavia have been friends for like 30 years. So glad they\'re finally doing something together. This looks like goofy fun. Completely implausible but some lighthearted laughs to spend some time. I\'ll watch 😁 Everytime I get together with my friends we always laugh the night away. Sometimes its nice to sit back and watch a movie like this so we can get a break from laughing. Like I would’ve never expected this match up at all but at the same time I’m here for it It pains me to be living in a time when a movie like this could even be considered watchable. I really hope the script is actually funny and interesting. I didn’t expect to laugh so much! Melissa’s movies don’t usually draw me in. But I’m mainly going to watch for Octavia They have been friends for like 20 years. I waited forever for a project with both of them in it. I hope it\'s gonna be good. Just watched it, and I have to say I\'m disappointed. I was actually really excited to watch it and it really had potential, especially with Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer. So I\'m really sad that it didn\'t work... The jokes, the coherence, the rhythm... I thought it would be fun and entertaining like Spy was, with McCarthy, but not this time. I blame Netflix for wasting the potential these great actresses and the original story pitch. Maybe they should focus more on quality than quantity. The crazy thing is, these girls are best friends in real life, who started in entertainment together, starved with each other as struggling actors, rose to prominence at the same time, nominated against each other for an Oscar, on the same night, (Octavia won), and now finally a Movie together. Go off girls. It gets a 5/10 because it had some funny moments. Melissa & Octavia did a great job considering they had to work with a less than stellar script that had so many plot holes. Questions like ""how?"" and ""why?"" come up a lot during this movie. When Netflix has you on contract and be like, ""Play a horny crab person"" I don’t care what anyone says but anything Melissa McCarthy is on she puts a masterpiece performance even if a script is boring or has no story she makes it watchable because that’s how good she is , love to see her with one of the great comedians like Eddie Murphy , Kevin Hart , Dwayne Johnson , Adam Sandler , btw I know many of you might think otherwise but this is my opinion I respect your opinion so please respect mine ""Everything about you becomes stronger""  I can see a message in that. I really liked Thunder Force! It was light-hearted, really funny and entertaining. The comedy was grounded which made it even funier. Melissa had me in tears in one particular scene 😆 Sure it\'s not Marvel type superhero film but it\'s not suppose to be that. Plot was simple, characters were very much human and not beautified like superheroes tend to be. It didn\'t make me feel drained like the usual comic book movies do and it was nice to just lay back and relax. Definitely on my favourites list ❤️ this is how imagine the world sees me and my friends acting like crackheads No way in hell this like/dislike ratio is accurate Melissa McCarthy\'s agent:  No way we could ever be part of anything as bad as Ghostbusters 2016 again\nMelissa McCarthy:                Hold my snack cakes I can\'t wait to see this and can only imagine the fun that Melissa and Olivia had on the set.  I hope there will be a bloopers reel. These two being cast together is a gift from God This may not be the type of movie or a show that might win awards but Melissa McCarthy just bring so much entertainment when she acts and I’ve never seen Octavia in a movie like this so who knows and I still think it’s going to be good Jason bateman put a huge smile on my face, such an underrated actor, netflix please release Ozark season 4 ASAP I never knew i needed these two together in a moviem this is gonna be epic as hell. I hope this is like legends of tomorrow..embraces the silliness that it is but gives us some kick ass action. Melissa McCarthy: ""Thunder Force, Remember it.""\nNarrator:  ""They would not."" This is the middle-age super-hero spoof we’ve been needing, people! This movie looks really good and I hope it lives up to my hopes. I rarely watch movies on Netflix but this is one of the few I will. I’m getting kind of tired of the same old superhero plots so this is a good change of place, plus I like the idea of superheroes who act just like all my girl friends. I would not have imagined these two together as a comedy duo but you know what? It looks like it might work. I\'ll give it a shot because I am sure to get some laughs out of it. Gonna wager a guess the Like ratio here has been corrected about a hundred times Maravilhosas ❤️❤️ Loved this movie. One of Melissa McCarthy\'s best movies. I love her, but most of the movies she gets into are bad. I wish Netflix sold this as DVD/Bluray so I could buy it. I don\'t always like to stream as my internet sucks. I would buy it though. CAN WE PLEASE JUST GET SPY 2 ALREADY!?? THAT WAS MEL’s BEST!! A much awaited movie!! Great actors 🍿 Mellisa Mccarthy never disappoints, can\'t wait to watch it Melissa and Octavia are absolutely amazing in this movie. I enjoyed every moment in it. I\'m here for it!! Looks like the kinda film we need these days! I just watched this movie and I have to say, this is the second greatest movie of all time, after the all female remake of ghostbusters. Yes, it\'s that good. I hate when comedy movies get interrupted with laughter and funny moments and you can rest assured, this is not a problem with this movie. The way Mellissa Mcarthy delivers the none existent jokes in this movie is just unbelievable. I cannot remember ever not laughing at a movie as heartily as I didn\'t laugh throughout this entire movie. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. In fact, I\'d go so far as to say I cannot recommend this movie at all. In any way whatsoever. The words comedy genius are thrown about far too often these days but, in this case, I\'m happy to say that this will never be an accusation that\'s levelled at this movie. Well done to all those involved that thought they could never scrape right through the bottom of the barrel. Don\'t ever let anybody tell you that you can\'t get any lower. You are a true inspiration to all those that are striving to reach the lowest hanging fruit. You strove for mediocrity and you know what, you almost reached it. Well done. 2:24 I was already gonna watch this, but seeing Jason Bateman ensured that I\'m surprised I\'m actually interested in this. It looks like it\'s gonna be fun. Plus I love the two leads😁 I love when Jason and bobby pair up with Melissa and now we have Octavia!!! It looks like a movie you can watch when you want some simple laughs. Nothing to take serious. I\'m not a fan of the suits but I know I\'m gonna laugh. What a way to spend my birthday.  Wishing my twin brother was still here to watch it with me. 😞 I absolutely love these two. I can\'t wait Okay, so I ACTUALLY liked this movie. It\'s not meant to be taken seriously, it\'s main focus is the goofs and cheesy jokes - which for me were thoroughly enjoyable. Comedy-wise I give it a solid 7/10. Plot wise it\'s about a 4/10 maybe less for the plot holes - lol. If you simply watch for enjoyment and humor and not for analyzing plot or character development stuff, then it\'s honestly pretty darn funny. I love these two together, and my whole family enjoyed it.  Yay ,I love those two. Movie looks awesome. Can’t wait to see it! How come this movie only rates 25% on rotten tomatoes and 4.3 on imdb?\nI love the casts and the story Invisibility: an introvert\'s dream. I can\'t wait to see this movie.\nI love Melissa and Octavia.  Cool since they are friends.  Should be awesome. the duo I didnt know I needed in my life AND NOW IM SO HERE FOR ITTT This was actually a surprisingly funny movie. Kind of a spoof superhero theme. My hubby and I laughed a ton. My favorite two people on the planet in the same movie?! I can’t handle my excitement and joy ❤️🏆 I love the movie   Olivia  and Melissa are great in this movie  . keep up the great work The trailer got me to laugh. More than once. Mel is such a cheat code. This looks awesome,then again anything with these two ladies is a must watch for me👏👏 As long as there was a script that they followed like 80% of the time, kept the ad-libbing to a minimum, and have the barest hint of character development... this could actually be a bop🤔 This crossover between netflix and the onion is interesting.\nImagine if someone actually turned this sketch into a full movie! YESS Melissa!! Finally! I\'ve been watching your movies for years waiting for a new one!🥳💓 I love this movie idk what y’all hating for Melissa McCarthy is the best what’s so bad about it So they team up, they fight crime but when old feelings come up they will break up only to unite for the third act to save the day. Got it 👍 Who ever decided to put these 2 in a movie together is a MF genius & I love you. I feel a lot safer knowing Octavia Spencer and Melissa McCarthy are watching over me I love them both ❤️\nMelissa my favorite female comedian of all time 🙏🏾 I want a thunder force cinematic universe It\'s Melissa and Octavia. I am going to watch this just because they\'re in it. Wonderful women! This trailer is pretty great, hopefully the film lives up to it. Definitely will review <3 Just when you thought 2021 COULDN\'T be as bad as 2020, Netflix releases this and proves us all wrong This looks so good, can’t wait!! Duas Patroas❤❤\nAté q enfim vai ter uma nova e boa produção no do Brasil So excited to see these 2 in a movie. Finally woohoo! I could really use a memory erasing pill after watching this trailer. This should have been a series on netflix. To be absolutely fair, this was good for like the first 15 mins, the set up was ok and could do so much without being a terrible movie, until it did.\n\nIts not like you need to follow the MCU\'s steps to know what works and what doesnt, its not even McCarthy\'s fault. The entire plot feels like something that was rejected back in early 2000. god damn jason bateman does one thing in this trailer and steals the whole show I wouldn\'t have ever expected a superhero/comedy mash-up but it\'s refreshingly different from the usual superhero or comedy movies. Maybe my sense of humour is broken but I laughed at every joke in this trailer. As I should. I like the movie and there\'s nothing really wrong with it. I don\'t know why everyone is acting like finding this movie entertaining not normal. It has a good and simple plot y\'all have to stop exaggerating your opinion. my god..that seal\'s song never ever  gets old. one of the best song in history Looking forward to seeing this movie looks good. Anyone else been waiting for this movie since the pictures dropped like 2 years ago? No, just me? ok. IM SO EXCITED I hope this movie is at least decent, because it\'s so wonderful to see superheroes as literally regular people. Not to mention the great representation. Brava. Did not expect an ""Identity Thief"" Reunion. The duo I didn\'t know I needed to see on-screen together. I’m digging the whole superhero genre on Netflix lately Netflix payed lots of money for those likes. This looks hilarious! Love it! Imagine being on a level that finds this entertaining. The future scares me. Two amazing actresses, will be a blockbuster 🖤 I think this will be good lol but I never imagined octavia and Melissa would be in a movie together 😂 This is clearly going to have me laughing my ass off. I can\'t wait!!!!! Imagine this is included in the MCU. the duo we never knew we needed 🔥❤️ Love these two ladies!! Can’t wait for this. Thunder Force is going to be hularious, and I can\'t wait to see it !!! This has me in hysterics.2 of my favourite women together.Yes.Can\'t wait.x I lost it when Jason bateman said that zodiac joke 😭😂! Who else tried to watch the whole movie, but couldn\'t go through it? BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DUO IN A COMEDY🙌🏾 so excited!!!! That\'s perfect for Melissa and Octavia! Unless it\'s just funny looking adventures! And I say... Right on!\n💙💙💙💛💛💛💓💓💓⚡👱👩✨ Anything that combines the amazing talents of Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer has got to be absolute Gold!!!!  I\'m in! Gotta love the trailer that shows you the whole movie. I don\'t want to seem weird or anything but I get to another level of excitement when I see Jason Bateman. This looks really good! Cant wait to watch it This looks hilarious 😂. Looking forward to it 🙂 Just finished watching this movie...don\'t be like me I wasn\'t thinking straight! I like Melissa McCarthy and I love Octavia Spencer, and this movie really feels below them both. ""what\'s that smell?""\n""It\'s the suit, we can\'t wash them."" 😂 Thats literally Black Widow on steroids.. I can’t wait to watch this. Looks super funny and entertaining. Both Melissa Mcarthy and Octavia Spencer are great so I have a feeling this will be good. It was actually pretty funny, it had me and my bf laughing, the lobster hand scenes were always were enjoyable. Yess lol a million times yes!!!! I love that she works with people she’s already worked with!! Melissa McCarthy: you guys want to see me play the fat funny girl again \nEveryone: No please God No!\nMelissa McCarthy:you want me to make another movie with my husband again?\nEveryone: No please God no! I love love LOVE these two women! I cannot wait to see this. Just sitting here, patiently waiting for Stranger Things Season 4 The duo I never knew I needed! ""We\'re never gonna start in a marvel super hero movie so lets make our own"" I\'ll give this a watch Melissa McCarthy pretty funny, don\'t know the other actor but they seem to work well together. Once its a bit of craic it cant be all that bad. I think it\'s funny how really good movies are probably declined by Netflix but they see something like this pitched and they figure ""yup people are gonna love this"" I wished to see both of them together Melissia is my secret guilty pleasure comic. It\'s not ""cool"" to like her. But I do like most of her movies.\nI also like Octavia Spencer, she\'s funny and also a really good actress. I think this will be a funny movie. anything with Melissa McCarty or Octavia Spencer im watching.. Two of the most hilarious Queens in the acting scene - I’m gonna laugh so hard I might just rupture my spleen definitely a must watch 😍 Loved it I love that they are playing superheroes as bigger women - I love to see the representation of bodies. ESPECIALLY in the superhero genre! Loved it! of course Jason Bateman had to get in on this! 🤣🤣🤣 This honestly looks pretty funny/ good to me :) Cant wait! Love Melissa! I love Melissa McCarthy! This looks like a lot of fun! i can\'t wait! I need a sequel for this 💕 best team ever hahaha 🤣 Melissa’s husband always suffering😭 Looks really good. Glad to see they made another funny movie. Kind of has The Tick meets Hancock vibe to it. This looks really good! I looooove Octavia...add Melissa, iconic movie! It was a fun watch. Liked the cast too, very quirky The movie we didn’t know we needed. ""two females in their 40s""  That\'s the best joke of the movie 😆 This is the superhero movie I never knew I needed until the moment I watched this trailer. Ok that last line broke me.\nLooking forward to this. I saw Melissa and Bobby Cannavale and was like ""Aight, so this is a Spy reunion"" and then saw Jason and was like ""Identity Thief reunion?"" (also Netflix please release a trailer and release date for Ozark S4!) Finally! A strong, independent, body-positive female superhero! I missed them so much! My only problem that they look too heteronormative for my taste. I hope it will be funnier than the last 10 movies of Melissa... Hell yeah. I can\'t wait to see Octavia play the genius superhero. I really liked Melissa McCarthy in Spy and my wife is a total fan of her as Sookie in the Gillmore girls... So yes she proved she can be funny and witty!\n\nI guess she kept her talents closeted in this movie. Of course we’d see a clip of Melissa McCarthy husband in the trailer lol! I love the fact that she and her husband are close that she always has him in her movies. This is a good comedy superhero movie. Its just that some of you are feeling so perfect that needs a standards which youre not deserved. Honestly, this is what my mom would be like if she gained super powers. I\'m rooting to this!! Already makin\' me smile.. Watching this trailer i managed to smile once. People once see super hero and trying to overcome everything and struggle to stay fit now they just can be super hero by ""being the unfittest"" our world is went back to the dark ages lmao Melissa and Octavia, the combination I never thought I’d see let alone needed. i\'ll be rooting for the villain Me, 11 seconds into the trailer: welp I\'m going to be watching this Yay! Looking forward to seeing this  looks hilarious I love it, it looks great. Amazing movie 🎥🍿 Wow, that\'s a pair I\'d never think of! They look like they had fun in this movie. Hopefully, I will too while watching. Lol! Bueno… debe ser mejor que Zack Snyder\'s Justice League, seguro. The scene where they couldn’t get out of the Lamborghini had me rolling 😂😂😂 I am SO ready for this Are we all going to ignore how fantastic miss McCarthy looks? Gosh fire!!! You had me at Melissa and Octavia. You didn’t have to make the trailer this good😫 I am IN! Can\'t wait! A lot of good movies coming out in April huh? The movie is miles better than the trailer. It was actually hilarious I can\'t wait to see this! love that like to dislike ratio, there is no chance that yt is removing dislikes right? :) Can we talk about that perfect editing in the beginning that made it look like Melissa actually rolled from the explosion??? Looks great. I don\'t think she can be bad in anything This looks awesome 🔥 If Gordon Ramsay reviewed this movie this is what he would say : ""Bland""\nAnd this is the conversation Gordon would have with Netflix afterwards \nGordon : ""Is this movie fresh or frozen?""\nNetflix: ""Fresh... fresh frozen"" Okay this entire cast is just awesome😂😂 Love it!!!🤣🤣🤣 Please please let Jason Bateman\'s death scene be him falling or being thrown into big pot of boiling water lol I enjoyed this trailer more than I thought I would.. This movie would have been awesome...in the early 90\'s. Good quality movie.. i love it I can\'t wait to watch it 😍❤😍❤ This makes ghostbusters watchable. In a world where you\'re dumped straight onto Netflix... Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer together... It\'s already a hit show people! It really bothers me that they didn\'t mention Octavia\'s Oscar as they should, above her name, 🙄even if it\'s a comedy, and I believe Mellissa has been nominated too I\'m excited to see this! LOVE IT!!!! I thought this was a joke, but OMG this is where we\'re at now. I can not wait for this!!! Love them! Love both gals.. hillarious!!! Happy to see Octavia getting more diverse roles, but Imma pass on the middle age superhero flick.  Hope it does well though. I actually am looking forward to this these are the super heroes i\'ve been waiting for. it\'s already out now...can\'t wait to watch it! I’m already excited to see Jason Bateman in it. Quality production by Netflix on the likes. My expectations are set really low for this. This way, it’s only up from here OMG, Superheroes at it\'s best!! I Love this series until now!!!😊💕😂 Can’t wait to see this!!! Remember the times when Netflix used to make exceptional movies? Jason Bateman\'s line just took me out completely! LOL I bet the likes cost Netflix double what the movie made. This is giving me I, Spy vibes so i\'m totally in. Love these two ladies! No trailer needed, I watch all their stuff 👊🏼 Wtf, Jason too 😲🥴👍🏼 ""What\'s that smell?!"" \n""It\'s the suits. We can\'t wash them.""\n\nNOBODY talks about how superheroes do their laundry. Even The Boys on Prime acknowledge that the suits the heroes are required to wear don\'t come with pockets and highlight every crease. I\'m so excited to see this Well unlike most people in this comment section ... I\'m excited to see this!! looks funny... Love these two ladies  and we could still use some funny in this world we\'re living in today :) WE NEED A PART 2!!!!!! I’ve been wanting a collab with these two since I heard they were besties irl! I loved this movie so much, I watched it twice on the same day. I never thought I\'d see Jason Bateman with claws. I can\'t wait! Definitely watching these silly women.  Love them both . J adore comme toujours Melissa est au top de la rigolade 👍😜 THIS IS GONNA BE SO GOOD OMG It was amazing. This is going to be EPIC!!!!!! What a duo! Love em! Not even a giggle until I saw Bateman and then just a chuckle. This will be for when the well has truly run dry. Octavia Spencer was in The Help and Hidden Figures. What did she do to deserve this?! Can\'t wait!! Best movie ever! Well maybe not best ever... but really funny. \nWhen I saw that critics from both left and right were hating on this movie I knew I had to watch it. It is fun.... Stupid fun...  If you are easily triggered, look away.\nI would give this a 6.7 out of 10. Don\'t mind me, just waiting for April 23 for Shadow and Bone. This actually looks good. I would have to be a yoga pant/tshirt wearing superhero because no one says you have to wear uncomfortable skin tight suits. I am so in for a thunder force cinematic universe... Can’t wait😍 I loved this movie 🎥 people are hating on it but can’t say you didn’t laugh 😂 it’s a good comedy I\'m conflicted because it looks good.but it\'s got Melissa Mccarthy in so it\'s probably going to be woke...but it also has octavia Spencer who is 1 of the absolute best actors on the planet.guess il have to watch and see CEO of netflix is the joker, just burning money for fun. I’m so glad that they got to do a movie together with their decades long friendship. This will be good Been waiting for this trailer for months This looks awesome !!!!! Great movie! Jason Bateman is so dreamy and had great on-screen chemistry with Melissa 😍 Hey!  I\'ve always wanted a Thunder Force film!  One ship and it\'s plucky pilot versus an intergalactic alien superpower and... wait. I’m watching this because of them. These two are my favorite actresses. This looks hilarious, Octavia Spencer & Melissa M is one of the best female comedy duo’s! Pom looks so good with White Hair, completely different from her MCU Mantis look 😂 ""Tammy"", ""Identity Thief"" and ""The Heat"" were really good movies. \nBut THIS, is just STUPID. \nMelissa McCarthy deserves so much more than this!  The kind of movies I like to watch...😄 ""Everything about you becomes stronger""\n\nHaven\'t seen the movie but let me guess:\nThey fight crime together, all is well until something happens and they have a falling out. Let\'s see: Melissa, Octavia and Jason together?? Don\'t need more, I\'m in I didn’t know I needed this duo Hmm, Netflix releases a movie trailer with ""Thunder"" in it the day after Melissa was confirmed to be Fake Hela in Thor Love and Thunder THIS LOOKS SO GOOD I love her movies 😭 I LOVED this!!! It was so funny! Really made my night. That bad guy King is a true PSYCHO!!! 😄 This is so EXCITING! Love these Ladies i literally love this movie Our Queen and Saviour Octavia Spencer playing a superhero is a dream come true Yes folks, we are truly at the end of the superhero movie genre time.\nWhewww Omg ! They put crazy and crazy together..... I love them both ! I cant wait to watch this. 😂😂😂😂 i knew this movie would be bad the moment they both said that they looked great It looks so cool! Octavia Spencer is an underrated actress. Melissa McCarthy\'s shtick got old 5 years ago. I\'m a simple woman. I see Octavia Spencer and melissa McCarthy, I click. And in superhero suits? I hit like. I thought this was going to be horrible. I think it looks pretty good for what it is. Seems like good fun. This is proof you can make anything generic look interesting again. You just need to find the right angle. about 50k likes to 5.7k dislikes\nyet both of rotten tomatoes critics and viewers gave this film a terrible score\n\nSomething is not right and Netflix is behind it. I\'m excited for this 😁👍 When? im excited to watch this. WHY IS THIS THE BEST THING EVER. This is going to be so freaking good! 80 minutes of “whats this do?” set up with 10 minutes at the end of “you’re my best friend” Amazing!!!! I love them This looks like so much fun! Melissa and Octavia: real life BFFL...LITERALLY!!!! I love these ladies!!!! They\'re so funny!!!! This actually looks entertaining lol Great movie👌👌 I see Octavia I press like. I will love this movie. The greatest movie ever made.... I can’t wait to watch this 😂 Can we get a sequel .... I loved it 🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿 I love that Melissa had her husband as a character in her movies 😂😂😂😂 like Stan Lee lol OMG - this looks sooooo funny! If Netflix would donate (a dollar) to the hungry for (every million) they have spent in a bad movies, there would not be hunger in this world... I would\'ve love to have seen Rebel Wilson in the mix with these two. She would have been great! Bring it on! Looking forward to it, thumbs! Omg they’re the perfect combination ,can’t wait for it... I\'m forever in for anything Melissa...and Octavia🤣🤣 She\'s definitely gonna make her husband get beaten in the movie 😅 Classic Melissa ❤️❤️ I’d watch this 😂 Your Writers Were So Preoccupied With Whether Or Not They Could Write Thunder Force, They Didn’t Stop To Think If They Should.”\n\nJeff Goldblum I hope this is a good superhero movie! Wow just watched it and I can’t say I laughed more than twice. A superhero comedy movie? \nWhile certainly not the first superhero comedy movie, I\'ll give it points for an original story.\nPlus, I would totally predict that this movie will have non-stop references to various comic books. ""You\'re coming him from the inside"" had me rolling, lol! I do not believe that when they decided to name this movie they didn\'t realize the posibility for mockery Looks dope. Can’t wait to see it Can\'t miss Melissa McCarthy\'s movie. I think we\'re almost at the point where we\'ve exhausted every idea for superhero movies This looks fun. Worth a movie night. Everyone gets there own kind of hero. Loooove this! This looks awesome So finally ! TF stand for Thunder Force ... and nothing else  . omg i’m going to laugh for ever 00:08 Kiss From A Rose by Seal is still a classic ROTFL!!! I love the film subvert the superhero troupe in such an funny way. 😄 MAN I smiled when I saw Jason Bateman from the Ozarks These are both brilliant comedians. I hope this is good. I love this movie. 🤣🤣🤣👍🏻 Another movie where Melissa McCarthy screams all the time. Can\'t wait, the bleeding from Ghostbusters 2016 has stopped. That is definitely messed up 😂😂😂😂. I love these 2. ffs is this... just give the whole production budget to charity next time. Just me patiently waiting for season 2 of ""I Am Not Okay With This"" I love both of them individually. But their chemistry together is .. just ... not ... there. Wow always wanted something different universe not only DC or marvel has tags respect 🥰love both of them, can’t wait to watch I love that the movie is about strong women and different races being best friends! There wasn\'t one racial comment🤎🤍🖤 I love these two actors, but lets be honest the entire movie is just freakin terrible Oh i love this compound. Great and funny actresses 😊😇 Omg my two fav gals and they have super power! Yes please! Can\'t wait Netflix??? I\'m cheap, I can\'t afford Netflix! I\'m gonna have to pull a Netflix \'n chill with someone just so I can watch this.\n\nSo glad to see these two awesome stars in a great-looking movie. I recognize so many people from MM\'s other movies too: Jason Bateman from Identity Theft, Sarah Baker from Tammy, and Bobby Cannavale from Spy. And her awesome husband, Ben too (I love how they always appear in the movie together). I have to wonder in this day and age why it\'s still apparently so hard to get stunt wire flips that look realistic. I felt like based on the trailer and description this movie was funny in a way where it’s “oh that’s funny” in my head, but not enough where I would laugh out loud. This was lame. Netflix should understand just because they can make movies, doesn\'t mean they should... most of them are pretty awful I\'m so excited for this! Yes! this looks like FUN! When you open up with Seal, I\'m a hundred percent watching it. This looks like a fun movie, but then Jason Bateman popped up so I\'m definitely watching this. all i have to say...is that if this is the TOP flic on netflix, i feel bad for society as a whole Okay, but ""Lydia, do not throw that bus"" has the same energy as Perfuma telling She-ra that ""We do not throw tanks at our friends"". this is so amazing! excites so much to watch this! God damn it, it was looking lame, but then Jason Bateman showed up and now I gotta watch this. I feel like Netflix is releasing so many superpower movies cause they\'re prepping us for when it happens and we\'ll all be like ""oh well, powers, cool, what else?"" I love them so much 😂 I\'m not gonna say anything before actually watch the movie, but from my experience. Yeah, this is a hard pass =)))) Can\'t wait. I\'m choosing to construe this as the sequel to Spy (2015). Looks very good. I must have lost half my brain capacity just by watching the full trailer... I don\'t think I could survive watching the movie, sorry. I like that they start by singing a song made famous by another superhero film (Batman Forever). This looks hilarious! Oh god, if McCarthy and Bateman could just be in everything together, plz and thank you. I just watched it and I loved it. Very funny. I’m so glad Melissa and Octavia are friends!!! I’d that her black friend or her real friend? The  Trailer is more interesting than the movie itself Her first super-villain she\'s fighting is a crab-man, like the first monster Saitama (from One Punch Man) fought?? 🤣 Can\'t wait, two of the funniest women on earth, yeah bring it on Spencer and McCarthy with Bateman----  hell yessssssssssss!!! This looks funnier than I expected. Lovely seeing Bateman at the end there 😍 Full of superpowers in Hollywood. This looks hilarious! 😂 I won\'t renew Netflix, but that said Melissa McCarthy is awesome. They started singing Seal, I must watch So Marissa gets Awesome Super Strength \n\nOctavia gets...invisibility with a taser I\'ve been waiting for this one! Can\'t wait This looks really good looks funny hope it does well Everyone in the comments is being so weird- does nobody else find it rly exciting to see two middle aged women as superheros?! Who else thought we would see this in our whole lives? Gosh I hope the movie is as fun as the promo. It looks like a franchise or a series pilot. Fingers crossed. Best duo ever 😆 What is wrong with you weirdos in these comments?\nThis series actually looks good and fresh enough.\nKinda elderly making formulas?\nThink about the plot twists, characters and series spin offs. I like the movie doesn\'t take it\'s self seriously. I\'m a fan of both so I\'m watching regardless. ""Do chicks have groins?"" Am I really supposed to believe that women aren\'t familiar with their own bodies? All I know is it has Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer which is all i need. Whether the film is good or bad, I like the fact that Octavia is doing different genres now, not like Viola Davis, same repetitive stuff They chose the right duo🙌 If the trailer is not even funny, that gives me \'high\' hopes for the movie. Would’ve been nice if it were based in space and then battling extraterrestrials 👽 Am I the only one that finds this trailer entertaining and I want to watch the movie so bad but don\'t know where to watch it for free Thunder Force: The Ghostbusters reboot to end all reboots When your villans are more dope than heroes Melissa is actually funny and her movies were great too. y’all just overhate this woman since Bridesmaids. 🙄 looks great !!! Yes. Yes. Yes. 🙏🏼 Excited to see this! this is so cool and interesting Yeah, I\'m all for seeing more BBW superheroines!    Next, they need to make a movie of Valiant Comics\' Faith (but do a Harbinger movie first) and Big Bertha from the Great Lakes Avengers. Well....\nit\'s better than 2016\'s Ghost Buster at least. hilarous as always melissa mc carthy and poor husband gets the worst part ever When you\'re just trying to rest your tootsies. 😆 And what an interesting cast. I hope it\'s fun like Spy. Lmao, just seeing them in the opening scene singing is enough to make me crack up I saw this. Painful to watch. Melissa McCarthy tried, but it was clear that octavia Spencer’s heart just wasn’t in it Looks like a mixture of One-Punch Man and My Hero Academio :D The shortest but clearest summary of a movie The “look at me I’m fat and clumsy” shtick is getting old now. The last superhero thing Netflix did was underwhelming These 2 are unstoppable!! In real life too 🥰 Mellisa is so beautiful I adore her❤️ anything with Melissa is hilarious. This looks pretty good Wow, so diverse and strong women. ""4 weeks earlier ""....well, mortys gonna hate this story. The perfect tandem I\'m just waiting for that 40% Rotten tomato score and 5.7 score on IMDB.....which I\'ll politely ignore and still enjoy this movie this is it. 🔥❤️ Finally Octavia Spencer is given a comedy to shoulder. She keeps getting dramatic roles and nobody knows how funny she can be. I watch the movie and it was great I can’t stop laughing Written and directed by Ben Falcone. (He also made the masterpieces Tammy and Life of the Party)\nHusband of Melissa McCarthy.\nImagine having dinner with these people... From the title, I thought this is a game movie adaptation of side scrolling flight shooter ""Thunder Force"" game series LMAO The astrology joke has me ROLLING Hope Peter can make the leap from X to Thunder. now, this is the real BIG BIG MOVIE I\'m... I approve! 👌 Why did they have to name this after one of my favorite Video game series? 🙃 Yo, I actually wanna see this. Omg good job producers. Im down for this. Def my next blunt smoking watching movie. I tend to laugh louder when the herb is involved😂. melisa mcarthy is hilariuos I love that the Black woman’s the successful one out of the duo!! Im so ready for this 42 mins in and they have just finished the 33 day training montage and I cannot remember what they are training for. Wtf! Bateman coming in at the 11th hour in all his hotness making this a must see. 😂✌🏻 Looks like one of the ""season 2 never came"" shows Just what we needed:  a ""Ghostbusters 2016"" for 2021... Ma and Michelle what a great combo 😄😂 La peli cumple su cometido, que es hacernos reír, la banda sonora es lo que más disfruté, aunque faltaron temazos, y no escuché sonar en ningún momento a Slayer, tanto que Melisa lucía la remera... en fin, le doy solo 3 estrellas porque no deja de ser otro instrumento de propaganda para instaurar en la sociedad la infame discriminación positiva, es tan nocivo como los estereotipos ya establecidos desde hace décadas, cualquier persona con 2 dedos de frente sabe que esto de ""los cuerpos no hegemónicos"" son una apología a la mala alimentación de las personas, es tan dañino para la salud las personas extremadamente delgadas como las obesas, mí madre murió de un infarto e internada con erisipela producto de su diabetes derivada de su mala alimentación y obesidad mórbida, háganse un favor, si ven este tipo de cine, no se dejen lavar el cerebro y solo limítense a disfrutar de los chistes. Looks like the Ghostbusters 2016 sequel we never asked for. i wasnt expect jason bateman 🤣 “My mistake was thinking that movies could be art.”\n-Jesus Hope it does well. It’s written and directed by Ben Falcone, Melissa’s husband. Good guy. Still looks better than Ghostbusters 2016. WENT FROM STEALING IDENTITIES TO BECOMING A SUPER HERO I will watch this show, purely for the J-man cameo. 1:06 - Ain\'t that the cat from Naked Brothers Band? \nDamn time flies. Funniest part of the whole trailer is the last line ""that\'s messed up""... stupid shit now adays I Can\'t wait to watch🍿! Once again this just proves that Super heroes are the cause of Super villains, not the cure for them. Add 3 more and we\'ll have the all Female Thunderbird. Finally super heroes (woman) that are not skinny I’m loving this one \nCan’t wait to see it I love this movie I\'m watching it right now 22:38 April Friday 9 ❤️ Sorry Netflix this movie was absolutely horrific, I lasted 30 minutes and I hate myself for putting myself through those 30 minutes. This movie is officially the worst movie I’ve seen since the equally horrific starship troopers 3; yet that was more entertaining than this utter garbage.\nIt’s not funny, it’s not clever it’s just absolutely awful. This looks funny af. I love Octavia Spencer! Melissa McCarthy became the female Adam Sandler Wasn\'t impressed by the trailer, but I do hope the movie itself is enjoyable Yeeesssss! If not for nothing but “SEAL”, as the superhero intro theme.\n\nMust’ve watched the 1990s Batman movie clip a 1000x over, for the song alone.\n🎶Ba da daaaah~ ba da daaah~ daaaaaaaaah! 🎶 I\'m sure this ""film"" will do fine. When I first saw this pop up on my suggestion I thought Oliva Spencer was going to be like a Batman type hero and have a bunch of cool gadgets but now I see she can go invisible like The Shadow who was a proto Batman! listen, the movie might look like shit, but i think we can all appreciate that melissa mccarthy\'s husband always shows up in movies with her If an asteroid could go ahead and smash into earth that would be great. Humanity just hit rock bottom lmao this looks awesome 0:58 \'Everything about you becomes stronger\'\nMelissa McCarthy  doesn\'t need superpowers to be super annoying. lol love ❤️ it I love these two queens Just finished \nFun feel good movie Also it is funny that Netflix Actualy show basicly Every ""action scene in the movie "" Great work  Will this be voted worst movie 2021 ... Probably- That trailer was surprisingly funny This is how you write good female protagonists; already know it’ll be better than that female ghostbusters debacle Was dyin laughing... this is gonna be epic! wow im frickin in love now awesome and funny, the great funny ladies Octavia and Melissa ADAM SANDLER COULDNT EVEN MAKE SOMETHING THIS BAD! cant wait to watch and blaze gonna be funny This is like Ghostbusters all over again. I caught myself thinking ""is it sexist that i assume the movie is shit just because the cover art only has women?"". Then I watched the trailer and realized that nah, the movie is just shit. Can\'t wait. Love Melissa and Octavia. I am so ready for this level of laughter This looks really good and a Netflix movie at that. I’m Impressed !! I can wait for Stranger Things as long as you bring me show like that👍👍👍 Even Jason Batemen couldn\'t fix this Invisibility: an introvert\'s dream. So the writer thought that, we have young men, women and children in our superheroes collection, why not experiment with Super-Aunties too.🤔 Definitely it would be hilarious. This could be funny and whacky or a downright bust, but its on Netflix and most customers are on a dripfeed of quality content, so we\'ll probably watch this. Me always: looking in comment section to see if the movie is worth my time.\n20 min. later, lot\'s of giggles, still don\'t know 🙄 It\'s like melissa has her own set of people It may not be funny but it\'s lighthearted, which i like about movies. Y\'all don\'t need to shit on everything js, you knew what you were in for and still watched it How can we not stop 2 chicks in their 40s 😂😂😂😂 Omg, this is a partnership that will make me finally get Netflix Lol I love this duo Watched this. Was it the greatest movie? No. But knowing these two amazing ladies, who happen to be friends for over twenty years, have so much fun on set made it so worth it. Ever notice how everyone\'s a critic these days? I miss my youth. ive seen this movie a billion times Большие проблемы = большие ""супергерои"". \nЛогично. This looks so damn good This is so horrible, I really am now about to cancel NF as it just seems to get worse and worse. omg both of them are my favs😭❤ I love this - simply for the AC/DC theme song! Absolutely dreadful! Thanks netflix! Also thanks for the new Bruce Willis film!! 🤣 Looks like Marty Byrde is finally exploring other types of financial ventures. If only I had Netflix 😩 “Everything about you becomes stronger” … does she includes periods, heavy sweating and rash? this is a movie i knew was good from the cover itself Thanks I\'ve practically watched the damn thing now. I like the idea of not-so-typical superheroes but they could’ve done better on the writing So she struggles to fight a guy with no powers but can Yeet a BUS to the sky like it’s nothing. Yep, I\'m officially over super heroes. Video starts. Song plays.\nDeath: ""That\'s a good song."" \nPresses the thumbs up button on the video already. I saw the trailer for this and almost shat myself on sight. Queens This looks like a fun watch Damm I love ❤️ Melissa and Olivia Spencer This is going to be a fun ride Aren\'t they best friends in real life? I think it\'s a good idea to dump them directly to streaming. That way, nobody can say it bombed at the box office. This looks like fun. This is Gen Z, millenials knew\n"" THE THUNDERMANS"" These crazy movies and here I\'m still hopelessly waiting for Hancock 2 to be announced. Its fun to see  both octavia and melissa Awesome movie lmao y\'all are great Who else is waiting for a 3rd season of Castlevania I just loooooooooveeeeeeee iiiiiiitttt !!! Damn netflix must have hired so many workers to like this Finally took yall a decade to realease these movies Looks great This is a good trailer. I\'ve seen the movie, and it is exactly as awful as this trailer is warning you it is. OMG my favorite stars❤️❤️ lots of love ❤️ from Pakistan 🇵🇰 There are so so so many unknown talended actors finding it difficult to get into the business r now, people like taron egerton, rami malek, hugh jackman came from nothing but was discovered after working hard for so long Remember everyone, loud = funny As soon as Seal began singing, I knew. Oh my God, Melissa looking like a whole meal. Octavia too! I feel like I was the only one who enjoyed this movie lmaooo. It wasn\'t the best thing ever but it was moderately entertaining and funny. This will be closer to TAMMY or THE BOSS than SPY or THE HEAT based on the fact that McCarthys husband is involved. Melissa is the best!!!!! the guy in the last scene sounds exactly like the fox from Zootopia Loving octavia , she is such a burger fries fried chicken  and cola to me, she is just a comforting presence How can we not stop two chics in their 40s 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I love these 2 😂😂😂🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 so developing a super power giving serum is supposed to be a top secret and its not something you brag about to your friends, you also dont let your friend into a very sensitive lab where you store those super power serums, just a few normal human behavior tips for netflix The only thing that would get me to watch this is Jason Bateman... I just feel like the age of superhero creation is over , need a really creative person to come up with an actually cool superhero Super Awesome! ""...and all kinds of things.. rising."" LOOOL Just watched it. It was funny and light hearted. If you like any of the actors previous works, you\'ll enjoy this too. still waiting new season for  The Flash !!! I am a huge fan of Octavia Spencer... this was so painful to watch Yes!! I love this!!! Ghostbusters 2016 fans will love this Everyone involved in this needs to me fired. Jason Bateman is a bawse! I can’t wait to watch this Like my boi Superman said it before me: Is it called Thunder Force because when these two behemoths walk across the floor, it sounds like a force of thunder? When Netflix has you on contract and be like, ""Play a horny crab person"" Netflix writers really outdid themselves with this one Netflix my bro. Can\'t you make a superpower themed serious movie like The Chronicles? Should have named the movie Cake Force, cos they love dem cakes. La mejor pelicula. Ojala que saquen una segunda y tercera parte ó una serie... amé los personajes. Muy divertida, graciosa y entretenida. Para variar el genero de Accion/Crimenes/Superheroe. Está 100% Genial this city needs a new class of villains joker foreshadowing this makes ghostbusters 2016 look good I just realized this is the movie my wife and I accidentally walked onto the set of when they were filming in Atlanta in October 2019. We were wondering why there were a bunch of police cars with Illinois license plates. I enjoyed this one though :) Just about everyone in this movie deserves better A BBW lover\'s favorite action movie. Thank you. nowadays anyone can write anything and they make a movie out of it? damn...I miss quality... Netflix we need quality content now. With HBO Max and Disney+ you need a lot of quality or is game over. THIS IS THE BUDDDY COP MOVIE I ALWAYS WANTED I think I remember them saying that they were working on something I\'M SO HAPPY THIS IS IT. ""Do chicks have groins?"" LOL I don\'t know what the hell this is, but I\'m down for it. Trailer was a 4/10 up until Jason Bateman shows up and it shoots to a 7/10. Not sure I\'m interested in this though. this looks very fun whats the song in the opening scene theyre singing!!?? Can\'t wait to see this..bc I really like Melissa McCarthy..she is funny af♥️♥️♥️♥️🔥 I like it so funny Wait... So the white woman gains super strenght and the black woman gains the ability to not be seen? 😆 Yes yes yes yes yes the comedy queen Melissa McCarthy so excited 😁😁😁 and I love that Octavia ia the scientist 👌 and seeing more Bobby Canavale in films make me happy 🙃 Writers : So how many shitty ideas you want ?\nNETFLIX : YES !!!! I like the beginning when they sing “ Kiss From A Rose” 🌹🌹🌹 Спасибо за стёб! Надеюсь, там будут нетолерантные шутки? God now every time I search Thunderforce I get this \'non funny"" show instead of the Megadrive title. $20 says the villains gives themselves hilarious but the most ridiculous supervillain names in history can\'t wait not to watch this movie! I\'m already starting with it Netflix should pay Octavia Spencer reparations and give her a written apology for putting her in this piece of crap next to ""Melissa-I-make-Adam-Sander-movies-look-like-Martin-Scorsese-movies-McCarthy""... I\'ve rarely seen such injustice done to an actor of her caliber... Amazing 😍😍 Gilmore girls mini series please...we have waited for long...Netflix please renew the series...🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 New\'s dude: for the first time in history we are seeing real life super heroes fighting crime\nAvengers: am i a joke to you This looks like a riot. I\'m definitely watching. 💀 I hope this is a interesting moive to watch This is probably the worst film trailer of 2021, congrates netflix. WELL\nat least they start off admitting this is the new progressive reality\ncause they actually beleive this shit is what real life is like Can’t wait for this Here and there you think, ok it\'s getting better, starting to pick up, then just nope. \nI tried to like it, I really did. Fairly cool cast too, lots of money thrown at it, WHAT happened? :( I love you & ever movie you played in 💯🤷🏽\u200d♀️ I adore these two actresses but I\'m a bit disappointed in the movie thought it will be better reading the title, i remembered the term ""thundercunt"" from melissa mccarthy\'s other movie. HA HA HA Great comedy Netflix!) How did you manage to make them look THAT fat?))) Looking forward for your next characters! I even have some superhero names: KFCeller or Freak At Time (serial about time-travelling superhero) This trailer looks like a nightmare I once had... So this is like any other generic comedy except with a superhero theme. Got it. Dadcomp would never go on that one s  how. He\'s too good. This has female ghostbuster vibes Wow, I didn\'t know it is so trendy to hate Netflix. Movie was funny and chill, I liked it. Great performances from both Melissa and Octavia. Melissa McCarthy is the female Adam Sandler of movies. ""Thunder, thunder, Thunder Force Ho!"" I miss Bojack horseman. Why can\'t McCarthy have been cast seriously as a superhero like Captain. Marvel?\n\nGet her a personal trainer and lose a few pounds to fit the bill. Not chic physique but realistic woman appearance.  The only Thunder Force was me snoring 😴 I must be out of frequency with what the writers of this film consider humor. If these are the jokes that made it into the trailer I dread the rest of them. My two fafourite actress in one film !!!! The biggest joke is at the end where Netflix says  ""Only on Netflix "" and you find it on every pirated sites It\'s not the strength of one\'s size, but the size of one\'s strength. But here, what if that one\'s strength is an incredible sense of humor and not just physical? My philosophy-\n\'It is not only one\'s own size that counts, but the size of one\'s worth and humor\'. What it means is that you can bring joy and laughter to everyone, despite of how big or small you are. To make someone or everyone happy and smiling every single day and night.🙏 You know the Mandela effect is real if you ever thought this was worth watching. Great funny film Anyone seeing the parallels between Octavia Spencer\'s character and the friggin Nazi scientists from The Boys? Let\'s privatize superheroes, I\'m sure they\'ll be responsible and not, you know, people with a natural inclination to abuse their power. This is basically one of the films Vaught puts out. I saw bits and pieces of it in spanish overdub and was like ""that actually sounded like a funny movie i should watch it in English.\n\nIt sucked in English. This would be sooooo damn funny if it was actually funny. “Let’s fund a season 3 for mind hunter, it was a really good informative show that hasn’t been aired in a few years” \nnetflix “naaahhhhhhhhhh*\n“How about we do season 3 of narcos Mexico, we could start the next storyline with El chapo”\n* netlix* “ are you kidding me?” This was more painful than kryptonite Just watched it and I just have to say how disappointed and sad I am about how awful it was. I so wanted to love it. I am such a fan of Octavia Spencer. She deserves a movie of magnitude not this drivel. If this is all you can offer up in Hollywood then you deserve to go down in flames. And leave Octavia Spencer to real substance, and in depth characters worthy of her stature. Ah yes, it\'s not a Melissa McCarthy movie without her husband appearing. I feel like humour and entertainment were just what our minds perceived them to be but now I think they were actual entities that secretly died given what we’ve witnessed over the last few years in television, films, stand up, music and games I found more humor during my visit to the dentist... And less pain than watching this film. Jason Bateman always makes me laugh. Him trying to hit the button on in the elevator! Lol 😂. She threw the bus. That was accurate. You can’t think no one will get hurt. Your Mother-in-law is going to love this movie The line about the suits is accurate I just watched it and idk, I think people are being too harsh. I didn’t love it, but I can see how it can be fun for kids. It’s clearly a kids movie and I think the people complaining are just not the demographic for it Movies used to be one of my favorite things. Haven’t watched one in a while but thinking about giving this one a try.. let’s hope it’s not a bunch of politics and virtue signaling. 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻 I\'ll never understand how superheroes will struggle to pick up a large object and hold it over there head but when they throw it it becomes light as a feather and it doesn\'t just fly but fuckin soars Melissa McCarthy playing the same character she always plays. How original! Jason Bateman was worth every second I spent watching!! This trailer is awesome and is giving me super hero 🦸\u200d♀️ vibes this is also unpopular opinion: I liked it.. its not adrenaline pumpingly action packed and all and sure it wont get you all satisfied if you just go out there expecting to see sth like the justice league, or the american pie if you are watching it for all the comedy. but surely can be a good, sweet watch to entertain your bored inner child. And surely it is mostly for the laughs, but it does break some of the steriotypic expectations like smart kids always being skinny and weak and unattractive and superheros always having to be cookie cutter modeled and perfectly built.. The movie does have a really good soundtrack This movie had me dead it’s honestly funny yeah predictable but good over all 8/10 It reminded me of a hilarious parody of a superhero movie except the graphics made it legit...I loved it. I was cracking up. If we can laugh at lowbudget paralodies then what the difference This is a great movie part 2 please Mellisa McCarty will always be sandy Bigelow Patterson to me lol can’t waitttt !!!! I actually like it, gave me some good laughs. If y’all peep in the beginning that’s her daughter playing her as a little girl her name is Vivian This is fantastic. I can’t wait to watch this epic pile of shit. The blow Up while singing took out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Just watched it! Cracked up during the entire movie. I laughed and laughed out loud. Am on second lockdown, neighbor accidentally rolled over and killed my 16year old pup-she was my companion during the first lockdown and beyond. I needed the laugh. Highly recommend. Looks like a great cast. I enjoy them all. I’m getting ready to watch it now. 😁 “I’m sorry that’s on me” well that fixed everything. I’ll be watching mostly because of the official single from this I watch this on netflix and its so funny and actually theres a 3 hero there in the and just her power is speed This looks good love melissa she is hilarious Imagine John cents comin in saying “alright lady’s let’s get into shape” XD Her and her husband are in every movie together Just watched this with my daughter and granddaughter, we want sequels!!! Had good laughs. I enjoyed it. Telling her not to touch something is like telling her to touch it twice 🤣😂🤣 Can\'t wait to see this. Looks hilarious Lol Hollywood keeps betting on Melissa McCarthy, bless them 🤣🤣🤣 I can’t get enough of Melissa. Watched it and it was so funny😂 Octavia is a great actress.\nWhat she was doing in this braindead waste of two hours is beyond me. So what I’m guessing is they get powers fight criminals and then do one big mission to prove they are superheros Aww...Bateman...no.\nOh well, he\'s probably the best part of the movie. I will watch anything with Mellisa McCarthy Haha. I love her as an actress and comedian! I can wait to see it ONLY QUESTION... In that last shot, how does he take a leak or \'wipe\'??? Definitely watching. I know I’m going to laugh. Thank you Netflix! Will there be a thunder force 2? I enjoyed it for what it was. Their chemistry reminds me of my mom and her best friend, so that made this more enjoyable for me because it felt a little personal. How could they actually make a movie worse that Ghostbusters 2016? You think Melissa McCarthy would learn... Looks like some good chemistry between them!!! Hnm. I loved Spy and Octavia Spencer is kind of incredible, but this looks a bit naff. From what I can see (and the rather scathing comments), it seems like it\'s sort of a fun concept that could have been much better in the hands of a better writer and director. Vai fazer tanto sucesso quanto o caça fantasma só de mulheres kkkkkkkkkkkk This seems like a movie so bad it’s actually entertaining. I might just have to watch it I\'ve seen about 40 minutes or so of it before I had to go to work and wow. I chuckled once or twice due to just how dumb melissa mccarthy\'s character is written to be. Pretty predictable and they stay on unfunny jokes for far too long, or use them multiple times. I plan on watching the rest of it tonight wish me luck The Razzies are coming up and these are my predictions for the nominations \n\n1. Worst Picture \n2. Worst Director — Ben Falcone I think it looks funny!! I’ll be watching I’m just gonna watch for the effects lol Looks fun thank you Netflix again So I\'m the only one bothered by the fact that their suits look like a Walmart mix of Loki and Thor\'s suits in Ragnarok? •_• Oh my gosh this looks amazing!!! Wow! This looks great to see Wasn’t expecting all the men to be the villains in this movie, me thinks........ ghost busters 2016, oh wait. This actually looks decent for a Melissa McCarthy flick(most likely due to Octavia Spencer\'s inclusion)! Just watched it, predictable storyline from start to finish. Unfunny ""jokes"" all the way through. 3.7 on IMDb looks about right Comedy superhero movies are a hit or miss with me. I’m not sure on this one. I didn’t laugh but the setup might have funny concepts that I don’t get yet. Melissa playing a 90s grunge looking girl is totally something I didn’t know I needed 😍 This movie: ""thats messed up"" at the end, sums up. This movie was hilarious, I think most of you guys are used to corny dark humor jokes🙄 this was definitely a good movie This is going to be a 10/10 pile of garbage. Go Thunder Force. Thx for the black female superhero’s maybe we can get more!!!! Bateman always great and McCarthy is a gut buster, that crab screen 😆 The dinner scene with Jason and Melissa was my favourite I love this was a women based film!!!!! At least now,  ghostbusters won\'t be the worst movie that she has ever been in 😂 she wont stop making movies This is the epitome of woke ""humor"" Fat force, add this to the kiddy fiddling cuties sounds great! Well she still happily married so that\'s great news I guess the next generation of the human race isnt living in Leo\'s basement anymore I can tell that the Jason Bateman cameo is the only good part. I can make some assumptions besed on the trailer, but mostly based on the unfortunate climate of so-called entertainment we are now forced to live in by the wierd minorities. It will have all the PC detail required today that is pointless and crass. It will have the obligatory  virtue signaling and inclusivity components from the alphabet crowd. basically it will be shite and not worth watching, even if it is supposed to be a comedy, so no thanks...All I want is proper entertainment, not woke crap stuck in my face at every opportunity..I\'d prefer to watch golf, or even better, paint drying. there are literally nooo dislikesss.....i looove this McCarthy I get but wasn\'t Octavia Spencer in like, you know, good films? This is Karen Comedy at its worst. I have not heard of this. Wished i cudve kept it that way. MELISSA IS THE MOST AWESOME 44:54 in and have not laughed once... trying to finish this but unlikely. When excitement turn into disappointment god actions movies becomes joke to them great and not bad though. 7/10 Just to think in 20 years time this will be even worse than it is now. Imagine that if you can. Lol people just passionately hating this in the comments 🤣 damn, chill lol Better than 🦸\u200d♂️,batman,Spiderman,and Ironman its THUNDER FORCE!!!!!!!!!! Starring: Melissa McCarthy, Octavia Spencer. Co-starring: Chicago. I\'m in. Disney + is looking good right now a movie for the vision impaired I\'m in this movie ✊🏾 Ok Netflix wanted to be able to say “we have a movie about two overweight middle age women (one is a POC btw) with superpowers. Y’all wanna be woke, but compete with that ha!” So embarrassing. Who keeps giving Melissa McCarthy and her husband money? Almost two hours wasted!! I want my time back!!! 🤣 I love the jokes of the movie, its really great Oh, god. Poor Jason Bateman. Why, dude? Why? Just look at the stereotypical character roles, you know where this movie came from. Need to show this now 🙏 The only good thing about the film is when it finished lol. The only funny thing about the film was the crab man Superheroes in their 50\'s Just finished watching the film, it was okay. Watching Netflix is like shopping at Aldi Just finished watching. My mom loved it but I thought it was...okay. Had some  funny parts but mostly cringe. People are being so negative but it’s a great movie for kids Kiss from a rose ? LOL, Melissa is yet to top her performance in Spy. How original!! Ahh yes equality, when Chris Hemsworth has to train months for a super hero role and Melissa McCarthy has a burger and calls it a day. so, am i gonna watch this?? ...\'SHIT!!\' ...i gonna watch this. Here because of John Campea 😂 I say without exaggeration, that is the worst thumbnail I have ever seen in my life. I kinda really liked this movie😗 i watched the movie and it was actually good i can’t believe the comments are so negative Mellisa mccarthy my fvrite comedian actress . I will watch 😂 Good thing i never spend on Netflix.. Yup. Just as I expected. Ghostbusters Reboot 2.0\nTotal waste of time. Funny! Light hearted Thunder Force should be called Thunder Thighs. 🤣 Thunder struck playing in the background It’s Abby from Ghostbusters and the Grandma from The Witches I liked the seal cover.. That\'s about the height of it tho This movie was hot steaming shit I want my money back. OMG ....this movie was sooooo Bad ....the trailer looked good i was really excited about it ...but man this is easily one of the worst movies ive seen ... What song were they singing in the beginning? Just keep them away from the donut shops Wooo i wanna see this Does anyone have a link fir the strings cover of thunderstruck? I would have watched this if they casted ANYONE other than Malissa McCarthy.. 🤣👎 I think I’d rather watch Steel When Ma died she was resurrected and became a Heroin What\'s name this song? Please, help me, all day I have it in my mind OMFG  i have just watched the full movie with a boring sleepy face whole time  ..  lmao this movie is like 2 nerd beg the movie producers to fullfill their childhood dream... Meanwhile producers ... Wow we free whole fucking year because of covid19 pandemic .. lets make their childhood dream avenger wannabe come true ... I felt it was rushed! I\'m glad it\'s not an MCU movie. At 0:40 "" Dont touch anything... ""\n😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 💪🏼 ❤️ Why so much negativity lol I personally like Melissa McCarthy she has her own style of comedy. I like the movie Spy, I wish they would do a Spy 2 😂 Is this movie bad cause it’s like those SharkBoy & LavaGirl movies, or…? OMG...it is absolutely terrible 😞 How did Octavia Spencer go from being the first black actress to receive two consecutive Academy Award nominations in back-to-back years, the first black actress to receive two Academy Award nominations after a win, tied with Viola Davis as the most nominated black actress to date, winning three Screen Actors Guild Awards, three National Board of Review Awards, two Satellite Awards, two Critics\' Choice Movie Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award....To this Yet again I am entirely reinforced in my decision to unsubscribe from Netflix. ""You just took our only formula for super power"". Holy shit that\'s lazy writing. Lazy writing + self deprecating humor (coz they’re old and fat.....who would’ve guessed) + songs from the 80s/90s = Netflix Bonanza apparently MAN THIS MOVIE IS $HITTY BOO BOO. Meh, I\'m not a fan of either of them plus the movie just don\'t look comical but with these two in it then I\'m sure it\'s not. Usually Melissa McCarthy movies seem to try too hard to be funny so I\'ll probably pass on this one. When Hollywood won\'t let in any other big actresses. So bigger women are perceived as morons by media. This makes me sad What  shame that these 2 female strong wow actors said YES to such a silly damn and NOT funny at all movie! Big minus to both of you! I was just about to watch this movie but went to the trailer lol I will not watching this movie now lol 01:45, Wanda!! is that you!! The Drinker bought me here........I\'ll go away now! It\'s on my birthday THANK YOU NETFLIX The only positive thing I see about this movie is that it provided some jobs. Just watched about an hour of the movie and no way am I finishing it. There’s little to no story, all they do is scream and act stupid 95% of the time movie Wow.. trashfire incoming! Help me. I\'m at the US border crossing 2 hour car line and my mother started playing this movie to pass the time. IT\'S HORRID. IT\'S SO UNFUNNY IT MAKES ME ANGRY. I\'M STUCK IN THE CAR WATCHING THIS. SEND PRAYERS, I\'M SERIOUS. They have nothing to do with thunder, why use that title and use the rights to a song that’s has no correlation. They use a freaking taser and I saw one blast of energy and some green lightning I love Melissa but I can see how horrible this movie is gonna be Thunder Thighs And The Mysterious Disappearance Of Amy Schumer’s Joke Book Its horrible. Mentally cried my way through 30 mins 😒 Hey,look at the bright side.Atleast this movie wont be cancelled. Movie is okay, but I find Octavia Spencer\'s acting too boring while Melissa is too Hyper. 😂 Easy to dump on women\'s chick flick movies, especially if men find them unattractive. Turn it around and look at movies like Dumb and Dumber that women put up with. It was better than most and not as good as some. Why use her face like that smh 🤦 Movies like these Netflix India will showcase, but they refused the great Indian kitchen I have a bad feeling about this movie I’m glad i don’t have Netflix. Wow. Waste of time. 2/10 Escapism. Bring it on. More like thunder sister....\nFrom the croods 2...\n*Eep.....TanDa SiSTa..... This trailer reminds me of toothache, its something that is unwelcome, unwanted, and that you have to endure until someone makes it go away. I dont watch superhero movies, why theF i would watch this S? No, god, please, theres awesome movies in netflix, please do not do this kind of s...t. This film is worse than Ghostbusters 2016. 2:24 martyyy😂 I just watched this movie. All I can say this movie is.... “Do chicks have groins?” That’s pretty transphobic.... COVER YA FACE!! So so bad, couldn’t watch the whole thing, over the top jokes, very predictable, just bad altogether. 👎🏻 Absolutely terrible film across the board,anyone that found it hilarious or amazing must be like 12 🙄 Just watched the movie. Waste of time 😑😑. So this is what passes as entertainment these days. I hate it I cant wait !!!!! yayyyyy Face palm. Everyone be hating this movie cos they fat, overweight and their jokes are on them.... but really, they were given the script and it seemed ok to them to be apart of it so let them have their fun, if you didn\'t enjoy the movie just rate and leave... Yet another McCarthy dumpster fire. This is not thunder force of sega with the spaceships I was gonna watch it to laugh at this garbage but after watching the trailer this looks so cringe I can’t even put myself through it Ayo the guy form lab rats are in there One of the worst films I\'ve ever seen. Only watched it because netflix said it was number 1 film watched in the uk today. I presume millions of us thought the same. Why are u here?\nWhy are watching this ""trailer""???🙂\nJust go ahead n watch the movie coz this trailer is basicly a spoiler😀😭 This just makes me hate Netflix Original movies even more. Netflix movie My girlfriend have super power she cooking for me, cleaning home, wash my clothes and washing dishes! She will be good mothet for our  future kids! Is the receptionist the library lady from Young Sheldon TV series? Looks amazingly terrible What...the...%&#*\n\nI thought this was a joke, but sadly it\'s not... the plot: female homer simpson gets superpowers, becomes even more annoying Absolutely terrible.  Painful to watch Battleship music? Just finished watching thunderforce what a load of rubbish story has no thought what so ever film is just dumb and so unoriginal just reading that people who watched it said it was awful but had good strong black characters serious who gives a rats ass about representations the films rubbish like such much on Netflix This movie is a trash. Just waste my time watching it. Why not just flush money down the drain Did a child Write this? Is this for children? Please tell me this is a stupid first draft written by a middle schooler and not grown adults. Just got done and the movie would have been better with a different black actress as octavia Spencer was shit in this!! So stiff not funny I found myself skipping her parts because she was so bad! 4/10 and that’s just because I love Melissa McCarthy This movie was a waste of time. Should\'ve seen it coming since Netflix makes lots of bad movies. Am here cos I just watched the movie last and it was a waste of time, like seriously the movie is a big joke That\'s messed up Holy fuck this was worse than that Ghostbusters remake i didn\'t think that was possible Who greenlights these movies... One of the worst movies I’ve ever seen! Movies these days are a complete joke! Sad Melissas movies are getting really shitty . I love spy,identty thief,boss,bridesmaid .but i don\'t know bout this one. More like thunder thighs! Am I right? Super heros and fat Americans an iconic duo 💩🥱🤦\u200d♂️ Bad movie, bad story, not funny at all. \nBy the way why is it that almost 90% of the actors in this movie are women? Are they trying to prove somethung with that? Worst movie of the year, without a doubt. Entire movie was absolute cringe and painful to watch... This appears to be unwatchable. I liked her in heat and spy this movie is the worst POS I’ve seen in awhile Unfunny soccer mom basic humour. Meteor Man was 100x better than this crap Dunno bout other ppl. I had fun tho. Leo in this movie two No more McCarthy films please This movie was sooo lame What a waste of an ACDC song. Ah yes two fat women as super heroes This movie was dumb and I didn\'t even watch the whole movie dont waste your time This is just awful.... that black lady hates martin lawrence. This is just stupid enough to be unfunny! Bit more stupid or a bit less and it might have worked! Oh well, I gave it 30 minutes! Should have called this movie Thunder Thighs I love octavia spencer but man this movie is bad. This woke dumpster fire of a movie is is why I will never give netflix my hard earned money🙄just make one movie that is actually dependent on its good story and acting rather than shoving woke bs down our throats💁 Why does the Spencer actress look like a frog 🐸 This movie made me cringe like never before.. eyes are still bleeding 👎🏽 I really hate that song now ugh What a crap. Don’t even waste your time watching this. How do the same unfunny people get garbage like this made? It\'s 2 middle aged women who wanna end the power people and the other one dated the enemy and happen to have a craving for raw chicken and threw a city bus on a  fountain and not only that instead of throwing the bomb in the river she jumped right to the river to destroy it like wtf So. Many. Mad. Men. In the comments. Cry about it. Lmao Where has the shame gone? Enough with the rubbish of politically correct! Netflix should refund a percentage to everyone who watched this. This is garbage. Ridiculously unfunny. Who wrote this garbage? I knew this was gonna be garbage when it first popped up on my PS4 I decided to watch it to see if it was garbage and it was indeed garbage. Terrible. Someone said this was a great movie. That was more funny than any of the jokes on the movie. Abysmal Absolutely garbage... You can\'t be serious movie look stupider than anything that\'s been out in a while holyshit who funds this crap Yessir Dreadful movie. 1 from 10. Probably the worst movie i have ever watched Netflix, garbage in, garbage out. Is this kinna women empowering kinna thing looks so trash omg Eeeew, cranky mom ""Superheroes"". No thanks ✋😐 Holy cow this movie suckkkkks WOMEN.ARE.NOT.FUN.NY Women lead the cast and are super heros, theres a scene when a kids says dads, that lady threw a bus (gay relationship) and lots of other feminist, woke and canel culture bullshit.   Omg this was sooooo hard to watch. Its as bad as the new James bond being a woman and being black ffs That\'s all we need - obese ""superheroes"" that can\'t even tie their own shoes let alone fight for more than ten seconds without gasping for breath. Hmmm ThunderThighs the only good thing about this trailer is the song thunderstruck this movie is terrible.. Boring!! Welcome to the league of \'super ugly\' heros Seriously terrible from the first couple of minutes. Didn\'t finish. Total garbage By the power of diabetus Utter garbage Oh look a fat women comedy.

Mortal Kombat,"['NYH2sLid0Zc', 'QJHY4ggYCk4', 'UoTams2yc0s', '-BQPKD7eozY', '4ANaKFnOOjk']","['Mortal Kombat So what happens when one of the actors forgets their fatality inputs? Do they just jump in the air like I always did or??? Can we all take a moment and acknowledge that goro is 400 years old and still moving like this. What ana amazing actor Who agrees with me that ""Get over here!"" is the most iconic line ever? Fans: Say it say it SAY IT!!!!\n\nScorpion: GET OVER HERE!!! We can all agree that Scorpion VS Sub-Zero is something we all are waiting for among other scenes. Scorpion: Speaks only Japanese for 99 percent of the movie\nDirector:: Have him say ""Get over here""\nCrew: But sir, he doesn\'t know English\nDirector: Just do it I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SINCE THE 90’s! Idk if other people might think it\'s bad , just having the original attacks , fatality and lines , for me that\'s enough.\n\nIts like reliving my childhood for some time.  Can\'t wait for MK2! The storyline wasn\'t bad for this one, don\'t know why people bash it. There\'s definitely going to be a tournament for the second movie. This was the buildup toward it. Scorpion : GET OVER HIAHH\n\nSub Zero : Wait, u can speak english?\n\nScorpion : Im learning at hell yeah The guy who plays Subzero is one most brutal actors out there. Hopefully he shows it in this movie as well as his other ones like The night comes for us. This movie is dope! Can\'t wait for the sequel!! The guy who plays Scorpion is THE definition of perfect casting. 1:51 that transition is epic, changing from cinematic soundtrack toward the classic Mortal Kombat soundtrack... who\'s getting nostalgic after seeing so many characters that we had seen in 16 bits video game 🎮 in our past!! Saw it at the movies then went straight home to watch it again! THIS MOVIE IS CRAZY! 🔥🔥🔥 Wasn’t expecting much but this new reboot really got me hyped. Movie was a 8.5/10. Enjoyable and left room for a sequel. Josh Lawson carried this movie as Kano. Nearly every scene with him had me in stitches. Imagine this film in the cinema... Oh lord please tell me cinemas open near me when this is released! Definitely loved the movie. Can’t wait for the second one ""It\'s a birth mark.""\n""What do you mean?""\n""He was born with it."" Just finished watching it, man that movie met my expectations.... The end of it, without spoiling, made me think that there will be a number 2😊 gotta\' love Scorpion suddenly speak English just for the memes They shouldve just did a Scorpion movie. His story was the best part of the film. Kano with a heart in his hand is the greatest callback here Just saw it, it was great! Hope there’s a sequel. Hope there’ll be a tournament too. Jax: has normal arms\nMortal Kombat: alright you know the rules The sub-zero line gives me goosebumps They re-arranged the scene from ""its a birthmark....he was born with it"" to ""he was born with it.....its a birthmark"" which honestly makes a lot more sense Loved it! Fits in nicely with the old movies. That sub zero line made my skin freeze over like the man himself was about to finish me. This is gonna be legendary This movie took me back my childhood.\nNot memories of playing mortal kombat, but watching power rangers sub-zero is a creative killer artist. 🤯 death by frozen blood dagger from his victim\'s blood. I\'ve grew up watching the old school movies of mortal kombat. And me being the biggest fan of the game, and movies. I\'m so excited to see how this one goes‼️ the scene where lou kang spams the leg sweep alone was worth the price of admission Mortal combat will always be something legendary 🔥 Everyone just wants to hear scorpion say “get over here.” Is anyone else obsessed with the Sub Zero and Scorpion scene?? “It’s a birthmark”\n“What do you mean?”\n“He was born with it”\nDetective level 100 Just watched it! Yeah, it does the franchise justice🔥🔥🔥 Imagine being born with a Mortal Kombat birth mark and you just grow up to be a mid-level graphic designer instead of learning martial arts. Went and saw it last night. That is what the other movies should have been. \nThis is what the fans been hoping for!! 🔥 🔥 🔥 The “GET OVER HERE!” Gave me mad chills People need to understand not every movie can be a 6+ hours storyline in order to be exactly like video games. It is a considerably great movie for it\'s runtime duration This should be a giant trilogy. Mortal Kombat is the whole universe! Just watched the movie and still cant get enough of the remake. Epic movie! Best actors/actresses! Going to be 🔥 The epic fight between Sub zero and Scorpion. This movie understands what it is and takes it to full potential! Very well done! Let’s be real, you searched this up to see this awesome trailer all up again scorpion was always one of my favorite characters This is no doubt one of the best trailers in the last decade. The music, the characters, the lines, the violence, THE HYPE. Jax has so many different stories to how he lost his arms, it’s almost like Dark Knight Joker’s backstories for his scars. Ningun Trailer me ha dado tanto emocion como este!! Sub Zero will always have the coolest fatalities saw the movie last night, what a surprise! what a movie! Scorpion yelling “get over here” like my mama with a flip flop in her hand Just finished watching the movie. Engaging, pace was just nice. Strongly recommended, to get over the gloom from covid. May everyone stay safe! Mortal Kombat storyline gets rebooted\n\n\nJax\'s arms: ah sh*t here we go again Regardless whether the movie\'s great or not, ""I...AM...SUB-ZERO"" is absolute perfection. Chills every time. Sub-Zero literally stabs Scorpion with his OWN SOLIDIFIED BLOOD WHAT!! I LOVE IT!! So they re-recorded the \'Get over here!\' and it sounds way better. Who else miss Cary as Shang Tsung? No one can replace him. Love it!  Love these characters Finally the mortal kombat movie I\'ve been waiting for since the 90s lol 100% recommend. Just got out of the theater! Hope they make a second one They finally figured it out.\nMake it R rated. ""Well that\'s just ridiculous. Nobody beats Sub-Zero."" ""Scorpion: Get Over Here"". Now That\'s nostalgic!!!!! This is basically way better than the last Mortal Kombat in the 1990s Between this and the new Space Jam my head is going to explode 🤯 I’m literally 10 years old all over again \U0001f972 Kano will comeback with the real cybernetic eye. The way Sonya killed him pointed that out. \nRaiden wanted them to find more champions and Cole young said who\'s first and then the Johnny Cage teaser came, that could bring Cassie Cage too.\nIm predicting Bi Han will come back as Noob and Cole Young will become the new Scorpion as Hanzo told him to take care of his bloodline. “The fate of earth is on our hands” Shows Jax\n\nJax: No hands Imagine this movie if they had to keep socially distant from each other. It would certainly spice things up a bit. I’m just here for scorpion he will always be the coolest for me Ah yes, a movie of a game where you can crush someone\'s spine and they are still perfectly able to fight Jack loosing his arms are the most inconsistent thing in mortal kombat Just Seen it today, It was Epic and they hint at there being a Sequel Mortal Kombat I . CAN\'T . WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!! After my 10 year waiting this  movie is here🔥🔥\nI wish there is a serious come😌 Scorpion: GET OVER HERE\nSub-Zero: coughs\nScorpion: STAY OVER THERE Just watched it...!!!!\nGreat way to introduce(Reboot) the MK Universe. Well picked characters. Great adaptation of storyline for a movie ..... can\'t wait to see its cinematic universe to become blockbuster.....👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Love MK!! My favorite childhood memory was watching the 1st movie. Ok ok ok.....the sequel needs to have this energy to be a hit....the feeling from this trailer needs to be the key for a successful sequel..... Two things you need for a movie adaptation to be right:\n\n• Goku\'s hair 🔒\n• Scorpions, ""Get over here!"" 🔓 This trailer still gets me hyped up 🤩 Subzero stabbed scorpion with his own blood, that’s cold blooded For me the movie was great 100/10 cause the Actors are real martial artist and they workhard for this movie   cant wait fo the sequel  💪🏿😎🦂❄🔥🏯🐉 Hiroyuki Sanada as scorpion - YES PLEASE!!! Just love him! They could have introduced each character in a separate movie first, and then make a final collaboration movie, just like Marvel did for The Avengers. this is already better than all of the other movies combined Everything about this movie looks awesome Scorpion: GET OVER HERE\n\nSub-Zero: coughs Man the graphics in this game look so real! MK 2021 is awesome....I just watched it, its very faithful to the source material. No time wasted on romance and drama, just 2 hours of \'flawless victory!\' or \'fatality!\' This  challenge is interactive and impressive. The new way of fight. High Rating for this movie 🍿 This gave me goosebumps 🔥..., Wow what a action packed trailer looks awesome Joe taslim and many other awesome cast Going to watch this movie 🤟💯🔥 “Get over here” never gets old. Even after 100 years This movie was great, except for the fact that Kano pretty much carried the acting and cole seemed like a power rangers character. But other than that it was worth the watch. ""It\'s a birthmark""\n""What do you mean?""\n""He was born with it""\n10/10 I’d love to see Liu king do the bicycle kick on Kano Kano was easily the best part of the movie. The ""fight"" between him and Liu Kang was hilarious! Holy YES. Finally they are redoing this series !! WOOT! When everybody says his name with the music always puts a smile on my face WHAT AN AMAZING MOVIE!! EPIC ALL THE WAY BUT THAT FINAL SCENES...JUST GO AND WATCH THE MOVIE!! IT\'S WORTH IT!! ""It\'s a birthmark"" \n""What do you mean?"" \n""He was born with it"" \nDialogue 10/10 Amazing movie! Loved Josh Lawson as Kano! Can\'t wait to see it this weekend! KANO and KABAL\'s Jokes were Superb !!!!! 😂😂😂\nthese two were so funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Hope they make a 3d version because the effects are insane nd perfect to bring it back to life. Didnt anyone notice that Goro literally has the Hulks face? Hiroyuki Sanada,  60 years old and still got the moves and looking as badass as ever as scorpion. Respect! I’ll say this: Maybe the director can also make Street Fighter movie too. Omg!!!! My dream came true!!!! Finally!!! Mortal Kombat is back and better!!! I’m so excited!!!! 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖 Damn watching this movie, makes me wanna go back\' & play the whole MK saga video games. To me was a great movie..... just watched the movie it\'s so awesome can\'t wait for the next Great Movie with excellent animations, soundtracks and action scenes.Could have done better with the dialogues and the cast.\nThe dialogues were a bit cheesy and leaving aside the actor of sub zero and scorpion  whose acting were on point , they could have casted better actors for the rest of the characters. “It’s a birthmark”\n“What do you mean?”\n“He was born with it” when scorpions says get over here the iconic 90s theme played in slowmotion Finally a true, fatality-glorified movie the franchise deserves after so long 😊🙏 Finally a movie mortal combat always have deserved! В восторге от фильма! Пойду ещё раз в кино! Потрясающие Скорпион и Саб Зиро!!! ""If he got the guts to fight then, it won\'t be easy to end his bloodline""\n               -Sub Zero Al igual que el juego va a estar buenísima My urge on watching Fight film fulfilled after a long time !!! I like the dialogue when she said  “the target had super human abilities” ... that’s how they were describing them in mk legacy...I feel like they took pieces from mk legacy & the original movie & combined them ...I loved the original ... but I have to admit they really took the fighting seriously in this reboot I’m excited to see it My Childhood Dream finally coming true. ♥♥♥ Not judging it from the trailer. This is gonna be awesome! We all have watched that much of MK that we know its not gonna get any better now Looks like a video game movie done right to me. Can\'t wait!! You know why Scorpion said the word Get over here even he\'s a Japanese? Well he learned that in hell yes. Imagine growing up thinking a tattoo of Dragon is a birthmark. Joe Taslim who plays sub-zero also plays Li Yong from Warrior on HBO Max. Loving this!!!! Omg I’m so excited this game was like my childhood I’d sit there with my sis for hours, always liked sub zero and scorpion! Watched it 2x 200% loved it! Finally someone can done mortal kombat correctly. Saw the movie and it\'s super awesome! Ah had a great  childhood playing mortal Kombat arcade games. Hype!!! I’m so excited!! I’ve been waiting forever not to end up watching this!!!!!! Scorpion has always been my guy but if I\'m being honest this trailer makes Sub-Zero look like a beast This trailer is just a taste. The MK universe knows weve been waiting for this. The Hanzo/Bi Han battle is going to be epic, and we all know that. when scorpion said ""Get over here""..I felt that Scorpion: ""Get over here""\nSub Zero: ""You\'re going to BRAZIL"" this is so sick! cant wait to watch it we need the second movie with more realm and character in it 2:02 the way he froze the blood and making it into a weapon, that was amazing. Still getting goosebumps from watching the trailer Story needed a few tweaks but the movie was still great, it wasn\'t any worse than Annihilation also Cole should\'ve been Satoshi Hasashi not a random descendant. That would\'ve put more meaning on Cole\'s arc in my opinion. ""C\'mere a minute"" Gotta love Scorpion 2:21 -truly the best part of the trailer, also \'get over here!\' never gets old Saw it yesterday loved it❤️\u200d🔥❤️\u200d🔥❤️\u200d🔥 we’re going to watch it tonight again, definitely looking forward to the sequel!!🔥🔥🔥 Before Trailer: Expectation 0\nAfter Trailer: 11 out of 10 Love the movie finally 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 missing old days playing Mortal Kombat game on ps3 👌🏼✨✨✨ Can\'t wait to watch this...it\'s insane Have watched the movie and hope that a 2nd part comes out with KITANA Absolutely loved the \' get over here! \' Me after watched movie: THATS F***İNG BEAUTY 🔥🔥🔥 Raiden: The fate of the world is in our hands\nJax:😢 This got released 2 weeks early,  just saw it. Amazing.  Will see again tomorrow lol The way Jax got his arms has as many backstories as joker got with how he got his smile 😀 Let\'s hope Kronika doesn\'t reboot this timeline too soon. what a well-produced film, the impeccable special effects, the incredible actors, strong and well-made scenes, the best film of all time, that comes mortal kombat 2 Watched it..LOVED IT.. Kyaaa~! ¡Mi infancia! 😢💝💝💝 Trailer looks waaaay better then the actual movie My brain tells me ""dont be fooled."" but my heart says ""im going to watch this movie several times."" Still looks amazing The fighting sequence should of been more like the tv show, ""Into The Badlands"". After seeing the movie, Josh Lawson as Kano was the best part. He needs to see a chiropractor after carrying this movie on his back. Ok... now I’ve got chills! No matter what ratings those movie buffs gave to this movie, this was a gift to all the MK fans that have been following this game since the 90s with myself starting to play this game on the Game Boy. Jax: has arms\nMortal Kombat: You know the rules and so do I Forever Mortal Kombat 🥰 Just watched it was a sick film can’t wait for number 2! When the trailer better than the movie💀 Wish they had some of the OG peeps like they did in the older film woulda been cool to see them one last time !!! Scorpions line is so iconic.  It could go with almost any scenario -  see just fill in his famous line after each of these:\n\nScorpion as the boss at the factory disappointed at an employee for not doing his task . It\'s nice to see MK characters look like the actual MK characters. I\'ve watched it; it\'s awesome AF! The idea of SubZero and Scorpion fighting never gets old. Could watch hundreds of clips of them creatively trying to tear each other apart. Kano was hilarious 😂 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Mortal Kombat is going to be the new marvel series. Expect ten MK movies with a handful of sub movies for earth’s champions and their background stories in the next decade. Producer: what, did scorpion take English lessons in hell?\nWriter: he took some very specific English lessons in hell, sir. That’s right Excited to watch this so bad after almost 20 yrs from the 90\'s♥️♥️♥️👌 So you made a movie about a fight tournament, without the fight tournament... Sub Zero and Scorpion about to be the most dominant stars in this movie. It looks perfect to be honest. THIS IS A MASTERPIECE This movie was the bomb it is a modern version of mortal kombat but love the action ✊💪 The next movie better be the back story of Bi-Han and Hanzo Superb movie and desperately waiting for MK2 ok, let\'s not ignore how badass the blood freezing thing was Woulda been awesome seeing the original Lui Kang in here in a cameo just watched the opening scene and damn benjamin wallfisch. perfect choice. that guy is amazing. did great on blade runner Who thinks the theme song is cool in this trailer Just watched it and it was bloody epic Must watch film🎬. Best action ever. “It’s a birthmark”\n“What do u mean ?”\n“He was born with it”\n😂 🤣😂 🤣😂 🤣😂 🤣 Honestly the best video game movie iv’e ever seen Folks can nitpick about the ""get over here"" but let\'s not ignore that Subs literally did a fatal blow. I\'m hyped The get over here was lacking energy, but overall I’m here for it. today im going in cinema with my friends to watch this im so excited <3 \nstay safe guys The classic originals always win. Comparing these remakes to originals is almost like comparing new hip-hop to classic 90s hip-hop! No comparison. Classics are irreplaceable! This move looks like it\'s about to be 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Just seen it thought the movie was badass All that\'s missing is Shang Tsung saying, ""YOUR SOUL IS MINE."" Can\'t wait❤ It’s the 80s kids that are so hyped for this!! still waiting for the sequel I\'m so ready for this 🤧 So happy they fixed scorpion saying get over here in the movie lmao When you\'re 60 years old and can still move like that. Hiroyuki Sanada is awesome. Parece que al fin hicieron una película digna del videojuego. The best mortal kombat film ever 🤩 Man that was  AMAZİNG !!! 👌 Dam, this actually looks badass. Briliant film can\'t wait second🔥❤️ Subzero turning scorpion\'s blood into a frozen iced blade was pretty sweet. Happy Mortal Kombat Eve everyone. Dont forget to leave milk and cookies out for Shao Khan Can we take a second to appreciate how deadly sub zero is portrayed if he was real.\nAnd how cool was it to hear Scorpion say his catchphrase ""GET OVER HERE"" Been waiting 20 years for this Whoever made this trailer deserved to direct the movie instead of whatever we got Brilliant absolutely brilliant!! THIS MOVIE IS FVCKING LIT! CAN\'T WAIT FOR PART 2 OF THE MOVIE! The movie impressed me so much Wow 💣💥 Can we all just respect that scorpion vs sub-zero is the best part ever this one got me so excited, this makes the old mk movies look like a joke If this would’ve been anime it would be 🔥 This trailer is fire! 🔥 Just watched it 😩😩😩💕💕😩 I can’t wait for the sequel 😩😩 I hope they make multiple ones like The Avengers did! “Thats a Birthmark, he was born with it” \n“Yes..... thats what.... birthmark means.” Just finished the movie, anyone else notice that they re-did the ""Get over here!"" line?? personally it\'s definetely much better in the final cut than in the trailer 😫🔥 I can’t wait I’m Team Scorpion 🦂! Who’s with me? Looking forward to seeing this Scorpion looks OP Scorpion: ""Get over here!""\n""He said it! He said the thing!"" trailer looks so epic specially when subzero is making sword with ice and mortal kombat iconic theme, is just too sexy. Sub Zero: Rips off Jax\'s arms.\n\nErmac: And I took that personally... The movie does not disappoint! Finally, a Mortal Kombat movie that wasn\'t as crap as the last one :) Outstanding and superb movie!! THIS MOVIE  WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT 🥳🥳🥳🥳 Noob saibot is definitely going to be in the next movie Best dialogue i\'ve ever heard \nGirl: Its a birth mark\nGuy: what do you mean?\nGirl: he was born with it.   Hopsin should\'ve been play a role in this movie!! he got the perfect look im so excited for this- like very very excited... For all those who say ""they\'ve been waiting for this since the 90s"" where were you in 95 when the best Mk movie hit the screen? VERY Excited for this. Don\'t let me down life. Omggg I\'m about to watch this now!! If you know me you know I\'m a huge fan of Mortal Kombat. the fact that this trailer begins with a near fatality is just epic 0:51 Shot gives me MK2 vibes. CAN\'T WAIT. Man this was a GREAT movie.  Some unnecessary deaths lol. Of some favorites. But cha know! Somethings had to happen. And the ending! So excited for the second movie! None of them excites me more than sub zero✊ The new Shang Chi trailer looks awesome! Old “Mortal Kombat” millions time better then New ""its a birth mark"" \n\n""what do you mean?!""\n\n""He was born with it""\nHMM YES THIS FLOOR IS MADE OUT OF FLOOR OMG THIS IS GONNA BE LIT BOY THE WAY SUB ZERO TURNED SCORPIONS BLOOD INTO A DAGGER. \n\nTHAT WAS COLD AF People are dissapointed cause they expect a tournament. Instead they\'ve got a reboot and fresh world building. They are dissapointed that it isn\'t the outworld, instead it\'s a earthrealm vs netherrealm. \n\nBut tbh if they stay with their word to make this something like a marvel multiverse. We will get outworld on the long run. Folks needs to be patient and chill. So in the actual movie, they have the birthmark comment in reverse. She first says that he was born with it then explains to Jax that it\'s a birthmark. Just watched this it is so much better then the one done back in 1995 it has so much more in it I\'m guessing they\'re saving Johnny Cage for the sequel Just watched it at HBO! Really enjoyed the movie! 5 of 5 stars! GORO!!!!!!! ЖДЁМ ВТОРУЮ ЧАСТЬ!^^))) Mortal Kombat in 1995: cast on point,  storyline was wack. \n\nMortal Kombat 2020: story on point, cast was way off. If you\'re defending earth realm, you\'d expect muscles or a big physique, but noooooo lmaoo meleena was not even close! Just watched it sicckkkkk loved it hahahahh part 2 please. ready for a MASTERPIECE!!! Why didnt they just make series of this The Director: “Well guys what do you think of the trailer?”\nMe: “I don’t know I must consult with the elder gods first...” Can’t wait!! Damn I’m really looking forward to this one 2:11 legendary dialogue No Kitana and no Johnny:( I\'m sure I\'ll still love it. 1:50 it’s so subtle, but you can hear the theme in the music. awesome Tbh, Scorpions ""Get over here!"" Needs to sound scarier and deeper The movie was fun af... soundtrack plays 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 The “it’s a birthmark... he was born with it” line may be the next “too bad you... will die” for the MK franchise Don’t let the ”get over here” from the trailer fool you, he did it far better in the movie Most fatalities arent really gonna shock me, just too desensitized from the games lol but cant wait to see how brutal mileenas is, shes always been sick Would love to see kitana in this movie, how unfortunate :/ definitely the best movie to come in probably years imo 2:11 the legendary dialogue Movie theaters: ""GET OVER HERE!""\n\nMe: 🏃🏾\u200d♂️ That looks so sick!! Just watched it and it was great fun.. Kano was actually hilarious amazing i\'m fans of mortal kombat ❤️❤️❤️❤️ This movie looks badass! About dame time they put some real effort in the MK movie They better have Raiden’s “AREYOUMYBUDDDDAYYYY!” move in the movie. Looks amazing That opening scene is a much better trailer for the movie that this one. loved the beginning and ending ....mid section could have been better ..... Else everything is super ❤️✌🏻🍻🍻 bro finally a movie im hyped since covid best part is that the hulk gets his arcana in this movie extra 2 hands 😁😁 “He’s dead.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“He’s not alive anymore.” Looking forward to this I\'m sad Raiden didn\'t say his most famous line: ""AIEEEBBAAAABAAAYAEEEE!"" Got a damn euphoria from watching this. Please do Dragon Ball next !!!! This was awesome! Best movie ever 11/10 Damn Jaxx losing his arms off the bat This had more views than the animated MK movies. If Subzero and Scorpion\'s fight turns into a R rated Avatar bending fest then that\'s OK with me. Subzero is a badie in the film. But him along with Rayden were my favs in the game! Liked Lu keng too! Scorpion as well Sub-zero was always  to technical for Scorpion.\'\'Get over here and upercut\'\', yea... it is a show move, but it\'s a limited bagage. Get over here still gave me chills for some reason Scorpion legendary taunt ""Get Over here"" Epic !Mortal Kombat for ever ! “It’s a birthmark” “what does that mean?”\n\n“He was born with it” Cannot wait! This looks awesome!!!! Buen trailer crack! Kano single handed carried the movie. Kung lao\'s death wasn\'t needed. ""It\'s a birthmark"". \n""Whaddya mean?""\n""He was born with it"".\n*My expectations from this movie are sky high.* The way he killed those dudes was clean I\'m just gonna hope Scorpion has an even stronger ""Get Over Here"" in the final cut Scorpion is the greatest mortal kombat fighter of all time period💪💪💪💪 This actually looks promising Sub-Zero looks amazing. Not gunna lie...I was waiting for that yell, ""MORTAL KOMBAAAT!"" Best comedy of the year! My favourite character was princess Shang Tsung. \n😂😂 When sub zero turned scorpions blood into a weapon that gave me chills Would be cool to see Cole become a form of Takahashi Takeda from mkx. Doubt that would happen. That music was awesome. The mortal kombat theme at the very end was a chefs kiss lol this movie is going to be dope Can’t wait to watch it Wish they didnt talk about the story, literly everybody knows about the mk. Sub zero vs scorpion looks sick nonetheless Waiting for part 2 Jax arms: exist\n\nSub-Zero: and I took that personally Anyone else been waiting for this since the 90’s?\n\nGET OVER HERE!!! \U0001faa2\U0001faa2\U0001faa2\U0001faa2\U0001faa2\U0001faa2 Finished the movie! It was sick! Expecting a part 2 👀 I’m Lovein it Too excited too see Shao kahn ❤ Jenny Taft from Undisputed killed it as Sonya Blade. Sub Zero: “Again we meet.”\n\nScorpion: “Again and always...” Can\'t wait looks sick Man after seeing this, WB could really expand this universe.  So many lores to explore, stand alone movies etc. This has a huge potential... That... That frozen blood thingy really hype me up for some reasons XD Cant wait till that dragon kick comes out !!! Lumayan bagus sih film nya. Cuma agak kecewa aja alur cerita nya kurang menarik dan terlalu dipersingkat banget, kyak mau buru2 di End gitu. Padahal harusnya bisa dibikin detil dan keliatan lebih menarik alur cerita nya. Kalau bisa dibilang menurut gua masih bagusan alur cerita mortal kombat yang versi sebelum2nya. i\'m glad this movie finally exists They will always fight every realms and destinations🤯 Everyone is worried about the ""Get over here!"", and I all I\'m hoping for is a ""Your soul is mine!"" Хорошие фильмы делаются для хороших зрителей! Did Sub-Zero really need to do a spin just to stab Scorpion with his own blood?? 😅🤣🤣🤣 Where\'s my Kitana 😭😭 I’m so happy that this is coming out on my birthday So many characters id like to have seen in this like.. (spoilers) I\'m 32 years old and feel like a kid watching this trailer. For the Lin Kuei! im glad they pushed it back!!!! many souls are Just Not Ready!!! 😂😎🔥 Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion’s revenge was what the Mortal Kombat 2021 movie should have be Cant wait for mortal combat 2 Can’t wait too see this The trailer is awesome!!! the movie...not so much lol Am I the only one who just wants to see subzero and scorpion the whole fight between them because in the trailer they both look amazing them real asian martial arts casts 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Comments: Where\'s johnny?\nDirector: He will be in Kombat Pak 2 The music is in my mind all day 💫 We\'re waiting for next series!!!! CAN""T WAIT so many memories w/ that game A step in the right direction for real fans!  Bring on BARAKA! Me: they aren\'t gonna show fatalities?\n\nTrailer: FINISH HIM The iconic MK music is missing from this trailer Finally something to watch I’ve seen the movie . It’s lit makes me curious id Cole will become a DLC character in MK11 or even a release char in MK 12 Finally legendary movie huh This looks great and all, but I still demand it starts with a guy screaming ""MORTAL KOMBAAAAATTT!!"" that ""get over here"" sounding pretty weak but i\'m still excited 😁😁 Scorpion lets go 💪🏼 Im ready for a 2nd one スコーピオンかっこ良すぎるわ。\n真田さんナイス演技🙌 That\'s a ultimate movie I’m just imagining that in the end Johnny cage just appeared as a director and I shows that every thing we saw was a movie made by him based on what actually happened Love 💕 it 🙏🏼worth every penny 🙏🏼💕 I know it\'s a small detail, but I love how they altered Sub-Zero\'s voice to actually sound ""cold"". Like this dude is so icy, that even the air passing through his lungs gives a normal person frostbite. The best movie ever! Scorpion in all games: Get over here!!!\nScorpion in 2020: Get oululua here. So Sub Zero came from China without a mask on and gave Scorpions family a cold? At the very least it looks like a genuine movie version of the property. Whoever made that trailer should make next part of this movie They better have Shang Tsung say ""YOUR SOUL IS MINE!"" Lmaoo it’s always a different story to how Jax lost his arms Goosebumps every were What a superb movie!! The ""get over here"" part is much better in the movie Movie was crazy ‼️‼️ Sub-Zero cutting Scorpion and freezing his blood into a knife to stab him is like a new level of ""stop hitting yourself"" 👏 Movie is amazing guys. Great team!! Mortal Kombat\'s epicness in 11 words:\nTest Your Might!!!\nGet Ova Here!!!\nFinish Him!!! Imagine getting stabbed, with your own blood! Crazy! 🔥 Best trailer made for any movie of all time ever Wating for next part...🔥🍜 ""the fate of earth is in our hands"" -every action movie trailer it would\'ve been great to have shaggy in the post credit They really went all out for this and I love it! Watched it yesterday, not bad at all like 7.5/10 Subzero fighting Scorpion is how it feels to chew 5 Gum. Sub-Zero be like... ""We don\'t waste blood around here"" I’m not the only one that realized they made an orchestral theme to the original Mortal Kombat theme song once they showed the title card, right? Like it or not this movie is awesome, and bloody😃 who else been waiting on this movie since they was like 10 years old That’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen Watched it last night , really liked it 👍 Still waiting for Johnny Cage Sub Zero was always my favorite for some reason Coolest movie ever This whole thing looks cheesy and campy asf. I FUCKIN LOVE IT The first Mortal Kombat is the best of them all. Period. Let\'s go Scorpion!! Very nice movie,lot of fighting but it look like it need something more. Been waiting for this since Super Netendo Mortal Kombat 1 🤜🤛 Great movie not corny like the 90\'s ones If we don’t get a Johnny Cage cameo imma be disappointed, he’s literally a movie star, you can’t leave him out of the movie Scorpion be like: always wear your mask😂 That trailer should’ve ended with the phrase “Flawless Victory.” Look how dark the lighting in the trailer was      Way better than the production release Im 29 and sub zero is still my fav💪🌀 not much happens in the movie at least it should be a tournament or going to another realm Love the score in the background Waiting for mortal kombat 2 first in mk9 ermac was the one who ripped of Jax’s arm, then in Mortal Kombat Legends Gorro ripped of Jax’s Arm now in this movie Sub Zero ripped of Jax’s arm. Jax never gets a break JOE TASLIM as SUB ZERO 🇮🇩 We proud of you brother 🔥🔥🔥 This is such a great movie great job Always awaits mortality 1:15 - 1:16\n\nThat’s two separate scenes. Sonya didn’t say “that’s Kano” If you listen closely, she says “that’s” & then it it skips to her saying “Kano”. It wasn’t the same sentence though. Amazing trailer😲 ""I am Sub-Zero""\n""What do You mean?""\n""I am not Scorpion"" 😔 Liu Kang is always the champion This looks dope~ who just liked scorpion hit 👍👍 Looks way better than Annihilation already hell yes This gonna be sick no cap He\'s blind.\nWhat do you mean?\nHe can\'t see. Scorpion Wins .....Fatality! ...as always :D ""It\'s a birthmark.""\n""What do you mean?""\n""He was born with it.""\n""What do you mean?"" If noob saibot is here this would\'ve been my favorite movies of all 16 млн просмотров, все подписчики посмотрели молодцы 😁😁 Love this Movie. Shout out from the Philippines This might be the best video game adaptation How are Jax and Kung Lao in the FIRST movie and no Johnny Cage?!?!? SMFH WB: *Releases Snyder cut trailer\nDisney: *Releases Cruella trailer \nWB: “I challenge you Disney in MORTAL KOMBAT” Lui kang: there’s much to learn \nKano: tfffff 🤣😂 Woh woh woh \nThat is what we can say a mass trailer ❤️❤️❤️ BEST MOVIE!! now thats awesome casting work. Paisa wasool movie..❤️💯🔥\nLove from india🇮🇳❤️ Scorpion: “get over here!”\nMe: he said it! He said the thing! New line cinema finally got this right!!!! Awesome movie must watch kano was funny as hell. Anybody more badass than the four armed guy!? Liu kang will always be my favorite mortal combat🙏 Imagine reptile vs liu kang in 2021 I have to say Hanzo Hasashi\'s actor fits perfectly... Okay but Hiroyuki Sanada is gooorgeous in this movie. Like, hello. 👀 💙 To everyone asking for Johnny Cage, don\'t worry. He\'s just shooting Ninja Mime right now. He didn\'t get to shoot his scenes yet всем советую, ШИКАРНО , просто ШИКАРНО!🤤🤤🤤 Be like Scorpion and Sub Zero, wear your masks properly.😉 How many wished they saw this trailer and the opening scene alone That looks dope Great movie just watched ""It\'s a birthmark""\n""What do you mean?""\n""He was born with it"" Calling it now, If this film is both a Critical and Financial Success, along with the success of Godzilla vs Kong, we will Definitely get a Primal Rage film. To all who hasn\'t seen the movie yet. They fixed Scorpions catch phrase. after watching the movie you realize they totally flipped the birthmark and born with it dialogue Ryan Reynolds as Johnny Cage would be  great! One of the best action film ""it\'s a birthmark?""\n""No it\'s a trademark"". The ""get over here"" line is MUCH MUCH more convincing in the 1995 movie. Subzero got swag man brilliant actor childhood fan of mk That ""Get over here"" sounds like Radioactive Man practicing ""Up and atom"" on The Simpsons. Can\'t wait for ""street Fighter 2021"" movie, only old legends ideas or games like that would hit the ground running from day one making millions in views & $$😉😉 I\'m trying not to be harsh here because iu want some one to do it right eventually, but the acting in this movie was horrible, as was the script.Will some one please make a mortal combat movie right?and for the record,shang sung highly respected Raiden and wouldn\'t be so foolish as to challenge him like that. Hoping I didn\'t just see the best parts of the movie in the trailer... ""GET OVER HERE"" that sounds even better then the actual game This trailer already has more blood and gore than in the entire 1995 movie. Increíble. Kitana and Mileena are my favorite player\'s MK legends battle of the Realms is awesome imo. Cartoon movie but awesome. Check it if you haven\'t seen it. Does anyone want a prequel just about Scorpion and Subzero? How does Liu Kang look exactly like the actor from the original movie lol - It\'s a birthmark.\n- What do you mean?\n- He was born with it. Sub-zero killed it 🍿 Immortals played during Bi-Han\'s Cryo-Blade crafting. ❤❤❤ Great movie Aaahhhh men this gonna be awesome Great movie but writers missed chances to put great sayings in like, after Ray came out eye, they should\'ve passes the egg roll. And another, when Sonya killed vampire chick, before dying Sonya should\'ve said you weren\'t worthy. The missing part is no one yelling ""MORTAAAAL KOMBAATTT"" and legend theme song begin Yoo, man, this is sick🤙🏽 Just saw the premiere, its awesome!! Oh ho big fan of Raiden 🔥🔥 Scorpion vs Subzero \nI\'M always a Subzero fan awesome movie It\'s not a Mortal Kombat movie without a techno soundtrack. In original timeline Bi Han is too strong... Strong enough to defeat elemental gods... He defeats scorpion many times... But at end of mk 1 tournament scorpion attacks from behind and kills Bi Han... Jax: has arms\nEveryone: You know the game, and so do I The ""GET OVER HERE!"" sounds much better in the trailer,no joke. kung\'s hat is literally everything defensive Finish him !\n ( Rips his beating heart out ) MK2 is a must! Put Johnny Cage in the movie! They were looking for him in the end! Not to mention Shang Tsung is still alive! They don’t win the tournament till he dies! Is it true that there are plans for four sequel movies? They better have Raiden, ""Consult with the Elder God\'s"" and ghost on everyone awesome when scorpion comes back right that the end to help cole young beat sub zero.  makes it better that young is a descendant of scorpion!  glad his daughter and wife were ok.  Johnny cage is going to be in the next one. Scott Adkins would of made the perfect sub zero Omg its amazing movie ... Daaang can’t wait Epic movie 10 on 10 Stabs him with his own blood. That is some next level ""quit hitting yourself!"" Mileena looks really funny. It\'s like she applied berry jam on the sides of her lips.😂 Scorpion being the icon of this franchise is gonna steal this movie. Part 2 pls..... this one was intense Sub Zero vs Scorpion reminds me of the 1982 ninja film Revenge of the Ninja\n\n""Only a Ninja can stop a Ninja""- Sho Kosugi Iko Uwais should be in this movie. They got Sanada Hiroyuki as Scorpion, I\'m in. Imo the get over makes sense. It isn\'t gonna be a fully English accent and imo it sounds better. Too bad every casual complained and had them do a terrible dub in the movie of that line. jax’s arms has gotten more reboots than sonic has gotten games They should turn this into a video game. Whoever edited this trailer deserves a freakin bonus!!\nThey made me really excited to see a really BAD MOVIE! Ryan reynolds as Johnny cage petition Just a build up to a tournament that didn\'t happen.... 5 out of 10 Sub Zero so Baddaasss🔥🔥🔥 ""It\'s a birthmark.""\n""He was born with it.""\n\nI see it also includes the trademark im shocked......speechless........humiliated.................by watching a masterpiece u turned into a MASTERCHIEP SHOW So no one is gonna mention how Kung Lao sounds almost exactly like his videogame self? Me : Grandma mortal combat movie has been released\nGrandma : FATALITY ! Now this is called FULL ENTERTAINMENT Kabal: want me to slow down😪\nLiu ka ng: hell yea🤧 I can just imagine before every battle in the movie.\n\nRound 1: FIGHT wah mantap di kampnya raiden ada kipasnya princes kitana tapi kitananya muncul, ngak sabar moga rilis mortal ke dua liukang ketemu sama princes kitana dan jade Currently watching now and fanboying so hard right nowwwwww Unbelievable action Almost seems like it\'s scorpions revenge when he was just hanzo. #4 on the Top 5 list of Trailers of All Time Better than the Film. Subzero freezing and breaking Jax\'s shotgun is such a sick throwback to the original when subzero froze Sonya\'s handgun Kano is officially  Aussie now :) Jax has lost his damn arms in about 5 different ways. This movie will entertain you at the beginning then it goes down hill from there. Tom cruise is the perfect Johnny Cage for me. 1:40 is same as thanos entry in infinity war Turning his opponents blood into ice that\'s cold At least they changed “get over here” in the movie ""Get over here!"" \nNo Mortal Kombat movie is complete with out it So what happens after they died? They rematch like me in 2nd round or final round 😂\nFinish him! Fatality It doesn\'t matter how many mortal kombat movie will be made, none will be better than the 1995 mortal kombat.. Terrible commercial. Showed everything. Great film ‘Get Over Here’!  In japanese accent is freakin epic Amazing movie bro Why does this look low budget and high budget at the same time For at least one of the fight scenes. They should put nuketown as the background music. The way the song starts is one of the most iconic things in the gaming world Didn\'t know mk was going to be this bloody Came back to watch the trailer because it was 10× better than the movie... This trailer did one of best remixes of Techno Syndrome. 1NO. Movie🔥🔥 MK fans: Where’s the trailer?\nWB: We must consult the elder gods They need to remake the streetfighter movie or make a Tekken movie haha Who else wanted to hear the ""MORTAL KOMBAT"" Scream? This actually looks great!! We need Scorpion...the world needs him theres always lu kang thats what mortal kombat is Not gonna lie the trailer is pretty sick! sometimes, you should leave the stuff as it is. Not ruin it. Jacqui: hey dad how did you lose your arms?\nJax:Frostbite\nErmac: That\'s not how we remember it. We need a doom movie now Something about this movie doesn’t bring the same hype as the 95 one did. The 95 one was direct fan service, this feels like it’s more for people that never played the game. Johnny cage will be in the 2nd movie.Its revealed at the end of this movie. - Stabs opponent\n- He bleeds...\n- Forms dagger out of blood\n- Stabs him again 😳 Thanks for showing the whole movie in the trailer Dang, that\'s Hirokyuki Sanada as Scorpion and Tadanobou Asano as Raiden. \n\nThat\'s pretty cool casting. It doesn\'t look that great TBH, but it makes me want to play the game now. 😆 That\'s so badass Terry Crews is playing jacks Just to be a little nerdy they should\'ve use the soundtrack from the other movies it whave been epic Kool stuff, kooler stuff,  scotts stuff, sound test.\n\nOnly a true Mk legend knows. This is the best movie action  in 2021 There better be the OG mortal kombat techno theme playing during the final fight or im out. Connor McGregor would of made the perfect kano! yeah let\'s make it nice and brutal, not that avengers mickey-mouse crap. And please, no 16-year old teenage-female fighters to match the quota I just went to watch the movie, I truly enjoyed it. Great humour, action and gore as MK should be.  As a kid growing up playing this game. It ticked the boxes for me. My mates didn\'t like the acting in it, I don\'t see the problem with it. Story was great and characters/acting was great. It was all nostalgia! I guess it\'s quite subjective to each individual. Hope this movie great traction so we all benefit from watching a part two. Fingers crossed! ""I am, Subzero....""\n\nThat line gave me the goosebumps... Seeing this for the first time was probably my favorite movie watching experience since I first saw Deadpool in theatres in 2016. It wasn\'t the perfect movie, sometimes I even found myself rolling my eyes in my mind or just accepting what I am seeing for what its worth -- Ultimately, it was a fun watch and I went back for seconds (or thirds). Have fun with this one. My childhood has just flashed before my eyes again. Bringing the cartoon version of Mortal kombat to life is epic. If I get see to Sub Zero gliding on the ice? I will be happy. ""Get over here!"" I love so much that dialogue  ""It\'s a birthmark."" \n\n""What do you mean?"" Couldn\'t get enough of this movie now i\'m back to watching the trailer For me personally, this lived up to the hype.\nI seen original MK in the cinemas and over the years the fight scenes are trash and doesn\'t hold up, and finally we get some real blood and gore.\nI wont let nostalgia get in the way to know this movie is alot better than the original and actually has the potential to have a better sequel. That scene with Kano and the egg roll had me in stitches. I havent laughed that hard in ages. sub zero making spear out of blood of his enemy 100% lit damn This is a great movie. I played Mortal Kombat when it first came out as a teenager. I am almost 50 now and loved this movie. Great story I feel like each character could be his own movie Man, a movie like this has NEVER been done before.    Subzero\' scen are probably the best part of this trailer. I don\'t think other movie\'s or shows with similar freezing abilities have used them this way. Freezing blood as it splashes, that was so sick. With so many superhero movies nowadays, somehow MK still manages to make it their own. I hope to see him shooting icicles too. As long as Baraka is in it, we\'re good. I don\'t even care if he wins his match. I just want to see Baraka. I\'m so excited!!! I\'ve waited beyond a decade for this!!! THIS, is what I call a proper reboot! ""I am, Subzero....""\n\nThat line gave me the goosebumps... I hope this good as it seems Wow, theyre finally making it? First seen a trailer of this art and characters in 2012. My initial reaction is, what took so long and I hope it\'s done properly. 0:10 Jax\n0:13 Sub Zero\n0:25 Sonya\n0:26 Cole (has weird armor/skin later in spots of the video.) I named all of them in my mind lol. As a 90\'s kid I remember having a love/hate relationship with this game. So scary and yet so fascinating. Seems like this piece will be a good one. Jax and his arms...\nIn the Arcade version of MK 3, Jax knew of the impending Outworld invasion, and began outfitting himself with bionic implant.\nIn the first movie, Jax was trying experimental bionic ‘sleeves’ that looked like metal arms and drastically increased his strength to superhuman levels. The 90 mortal kombat is by far still the best one and it\'s sad, cause that movie, was even rushed! I hope somebody can give this movie justices one day! This actually looks pretty sweet. The effects are on whole new level. Espere este momento por años!  This film can either be a masterpiece or a huge disappointment, Looks promising tho I remember Mortal Kombat from 1995, that was a good one. Good to see the new school version kicking ass. It was a great movie! I really loved it! This MOVIE was sooooo good. I just hates how dark some parts were... So dark, even my brightness all the way up didnt do any justice. Other than that. It was an AMAZING MOVIE I remember playing the game on SEGA Mega Drive and I\'m still playing it now so this looks dope Damn, that part with Scorpion & SZ freezing the blood.\nHoly shit, moment. Sub-Zero taking full advantage of his powers is very welcoming. Jax and his arms...\nIn the Arcade version of MK 3, Jax knew of the impending Outworld invasion, and began outfitting himself with bionic implant.\nIn the first movie, Jax was trying experimental bionic ‘sleeves’ that looked like metal arms and drastically increased his strength to superhuman levels. This movie was amazing , they did the characters justice and also gave one of the best characters a big plot line!! The way they tie eveything in wow was mind blown and happy at the same time!! I think mortal kombat fans will be happy and also the soundtrack slaps !!! I just want to watch sub zero and scorpion fight thats all Never big on the past movies but I cannot wait for this one. I hope it\'s as brutal as they\'re making it out to be. This is actually one movie I will have to check out at the theaters ""The essence of Mortal Kombat is not death, but life.""\n\nWatching this with that quote going through my mind gives me goose bumps. i wanna cry. this is amazing. We all need this. It\'s been such a wild two years but THIS HELPS MAKE UP FOR IT A LOT OF IT <3 I feel like the “get over here” with Scorpion could’ve been way more intense in terms of reflection and modulation similar to subzero. Otherwise, I’m so excited for this movie. The way Loo Kang wielded his flames.. That\'s what we expect from an Avatar Live Action Remake.. I\'ve seen it last night, and i can honestly say it\'s a great movie. It\'s not perfect ofcourse, but the fighting is great, it is done right. I feel like they\'re the only one who can pull off a live action Dragon Ball Z movie que buena noticia, se ve genial el trailer, tengo muy altas mis espectativas espero cuando vea la pelicula sean superadas...!! I watched yesterday and it was fantastic  Now this is the real Mortal Kombat everyone is looking forward to.  Watching my childhood come to life This movie is going to be awesome. I can\'t wait to see it. Really enjoyed the movie,great fatalities great characters cant wait for mortal kombat 2 now,only things I\'d say is sub zero needed more fight scenes and scorpion Can\'t hardly wait to watch this movie :) 2:02 love that part ""It\'s a birthmark""\n""What do you mean?""\n""He was born with it.""\nI hope it\'s not too late to take out this scene. Really good film, definitely needed more of sub zero & scorpion maybe in the next one as there immortal. \nI hope the next film has sindel (main character), kitanna, jade, rain & nightwolf along with who we already have! Bring back some sweet memories, can’t wait to see it! I wonder what does Sub-Zero do during his free time? He thinks of all the creative ways he could do to kill his opponents. That frozen blood dagger part, is ... simply ... EPIC! Coming soon to an AMC movie theater near you. This movie will be awesome and watching it in a theater is gonna be so nostalgic just like old times  Just love mortal Kombat!! Shame they didnt get a 3rd season and more. It was perfect How you gonna call this Mortal Kombat without having someone yell, ""Mortal Kombat!"", followed by some techno-beats... Looks pretty damn good. Childhood I think the way Scorpion spoke was the film showing his Japanese accent with words. I kinda like the authenticity of how he and Sub-Zero sound this time  although the original get over here was legendary, Ed Boon\'s voice is 150% American  Looks amazing! Can\'t wait. i need to watch mortal kombat 2 ive already watched this its good CG really takes this stuff next level! There are a nearly unlimited library of amazing content that is decades old that would be so next level with modern production capabilities. Can\'t wait to see the full video been waiting along time on this movie to be released  I can feel Mortal Kombat in the air tonight, oh Lord. I\'ve been waiting for this moment for all my life, Lord Raiden, oh Lord. Finally something worth watching ️ Just one word : FINALLY!!! I totally wish this was out already I\'m glad they made Kano Australian as a tribute to Trevor Goddard\'s Australian take on the character in the 1995 film, even though he was English. Kano made the whole movie, character and actor are both amazing When subzero freeze the blood in the Air it was freaking awesome Fighting for something, like mortal kombat.\n\nAbout time some genius remade the class box office hit of the turn of the century.  I prefer the style of the mortal combat legacy webseries and don\'t know how it might have looked if the film had been green lit. But at the same time I think this one looks not bad at all. And this is a kind of film that you watch not for the story but for each action sequence. So there\'s a pretty good chance that you can expect it to be as good as it\'s depicted here. The little details like legacy\'s scorpian with his Japanese accented ""ketovahere"" are the little details that make it so good. The atmosphere of that fight scene between him and subzero in the snow  almost made my hair\'s stand up. And the rumble in the camera ok certain impacts like how the game felt. But hey at least this one is not gonna be some fucken dragonball evolution disasterpiece Childhood memories ️ I don\'t think I have EVER been so excited about a movie in YEAAAARRSSSSSSSSSS!!!! We\'ve waited for this sooo much.. It looks promising, I hope it is! Hell yeah! A good MK movie has been forever coming. I still remember the first part when the warriors were jumping out of the urns...freaking awesome ideas rock this series...This version is going to be even better with some mechatronics and more sfx involved. Yo we not gonna talk about Sub taking Jax arms scene.. Sick AF!! Finally, new Mortal Combat!  The director can consider making a new Stree Fighter movie in the future. wow. I have never had so much anticipation for a movie. I\'m dying to watch this movie Sub zero vs Scorpions the epic scene. I want it more Oh Yes!! I have dreamt for years!!! Someone would make \'Half-Life\' the game in to a Movie!!!! Its a brilliant story line ""its a birthmark"",  ""what does that mean ?""  ,  ""It means he was born with it""  me : slaps forehead Yo I Got Beef With The Way Scorpion ""Get Over Here"" Sounded REMIND ME OF TODAES MASKS LOL looks perfect! fresh cast looks very very good, budget decent, camera great, CGI satisfactory, overall more than promising.. now pray for decent script. luckily MK does not require much on this side :D otherwise it would end up like Monster Hunter probably :P (still much better than Godzilla/Monkey movies) Looks cool, they should make a fighting video game based on these characters. They could call it Mortal UFC From GAME into MOVIE REALITY BASE,  Haven\'t been in movies in a while. But ima have to make time for this one. About time they finally made MK Best part of the trailor is when subzero freezed the blood and turned it into a weapon. Scorpion and Sub-zero are the main reason I\'m hype for this movie ️ I can’t wait to see it !  looks so good. can\'t wait to see it. hope it doesn\'t disappoint. After long time mortal are back to rule️ Finally a good budget MK movie...looking forward to this one! Scorpion is my ALL TIME Favourite, followed by Raiden! Legends of the MK World! Kan\'t wait to watch this Without the immortals song, this can\'t be a Mortal Kombat movie  Sub zero has always been and will forever be my fav. Dude made a knife from scorpions fucking blood in mid air. Like wtf lol The \'I am sub zero\' is so damn good but the \'get over here\' needs a re-do. Can’t wait to see it  Waoh! It looked waaay better watching this on my laptop than on my phone. I got whole different vibe from watching it in 720p on my laptop. Impressive trailer for me. About time they made a new movie. \nIts going to be awesome. damn!! this sub zero looks and sounds intimidating.. he gives me this chills haha the movie was ok, asides from the first 10 minutes, hiroyuki sanada doing a killer job as per usual! love that man;s acting. i am waiting for someone a good director and producer to do mortal kombat justice (wouldnt mind seeing hiroyuki playing scorpian again :)) Glad to finally see Liu Kang and Kung Lao together in a movie. i just finished watching this and it\'s 100% worth the watch. so good Fantastic movie. Totally worth the Imax experience. I\'m SO glad I didn\'t see this trailer beforehand. I just wish it would have awesome fatalities like the game has!! the film is so good, can\'t wait to watch it live Amazing movie! As good as the original The great Hiroyuki Sanada playing Scorpion, right fucking on. My mom with a belt shouting ""GET OVER HERE! "" sounds more terrifying than this Scorpion  We need a part 2 of mortal kombat! ""Kano. Wins. So excited for this!! I watched the movie already...all I\'m saying is that it is AWESOME Brooo that frozen blood shot was incredible we all grown up hearing "" I am Sub Zero ""  \nthis is ultra legend mode cant wait more Choreography and gore are on point. I don\'t need a masterpiece. Just give me some good fights and kills and this movie will be dope. \n\nWouldn\'t mind a 90\'s \'Mortal Kombat\' yell either.. Regardless of what everyone is saying .. we can\'t wait in this 2 drop  TV SHOW AS WELL PLEASE AND THANK YOU \nMake these characters come to life  I got goosebumps when sub zero say he\'s name Didn’t see much of my man Scorpy but it looks  I hope this gonna make us remind of our old beloved childhood movie 1:50 Literally goosebumps when the original theme elements kick in. When Liu Kang turned into it\'s real form a dragon was the best scene, can\'t wait to see it looks ok. This movie has big shoes to fill in terms of soundtrack, directing, casting, and story. I really hope they didn\'t underestimate MK1 in terms of quality. Man, I can\'t wait! Looks like we are finally getting a good Kombat movie 2:01 that shit right there , chills!!! that sub zero appearance literally gave me... chills It\'s so nice to see modern filmmakers pay a true respect to old MK movie classics: cheesy dialogues, terrible acting, laughable and out of place CGI, overly dramatic character expressions, disastrous voice acting and overall quality of a 1-pack-of-beer budget - just like everything I remember it back in MK (1995) and MK: Annihilation (1997). Beautiful, 10/10, gonna watch. I\'m excited about this movie! Nice to see that the actors they chose are actually good matches for the characters Awesome! The good guys actually have their powers this time, unlike in the original movies. I hope they change the ""GET OVER HERE!"" Can they atlease make him sound more like a Hellspawn/Demon because that is one of the most iconic lines in gaming history my boss ""Get over here!"" is more spine tingling scary than that scorpion.  Finally they making another MK...Ive been waiting years!!!! im watching this I was getting chills watching this trailer. Oh my I CANT WAIT Damn i am so happy.So many years waiting Scorpion from every other form of media: ""Get over here!""\n\nScorpion in MK2021: ""GEEABALAH!!"" love the movie... cant stop keep on watching This will never get old!!! This movie is amazing very well made! I will literally stand-up and cheer in the cinema when he says ""GET OVER HERE!"" I watched the original 1995 movie in theaters, now I’m excited to see this one hopefully in theaters Looks decent. Big sack to try this movie again after the last time :) I like the way Joe says that he is sub zero.    I have said sub zero so casually for so long it\'s basically a compound word.    The way he says it.   No Y\'all this man\'s COLDDDD. Is it possible that they finally got Mortal Kombat right?! I gotta see it when it reaches the cinemas in Romania. To the people bitching about how scorpion said ""get over here"" you do realize the actor playing him is japanese right? You dont think it would be kind weird for him to yell that without an accent but then talk with an accent afterwards. i think they might have finally made a Mortal Kombat movie that we\'ve been wanting for decades.\nHonestly i had thought for years how they could make a good plot, this looks promising.\nAnd the action and visual aspect alone, i think this is going to be good.  FATALITY i cry everytime when i watch this trailer its a masterpiece <3<3<3<3 GET OVER HEREEEE ! Wow, excited for this..\nHope they get it right! I wish the rest of the movie was as intense as the conflict between Scorpion and Sub Zero ooooooo..! its amazing that as a kid I loved & watched this & now I can enjoy with my two teens!!! Just went out to watch the movie it\'s soooo good ""It\'s not a birthmark, it means you\'ve been chosen""\n\nDoesn\'t mean it\'s still not a birthmark. . Shout out to all MK fans since Sega and Super Nintendo! This looks insane! This looks amazing! Man I wish I could play as sub zero one day that’s so cool. I love it can’t wait to see it Looks awesome can\'t wait Mortal Kombat\'s epicness in 11 words:\nTest Your Might!!!\nGet Ova Here!!!\nFinish Him!!! ""Well, you see, he chops his arm off and stabs him with his own frozen blood.""\n\nMe: ...fine I\'ll watch it. With a budget as high as $35,000, and the actors to match. Go MK! Remember, the movie ain\'t never gonna be that cool as the times you\'ve spent playing MK with your friends espeically if you were one of those who played it around 2010 decade. Just sayin. Good old days. Goosebumps. without the epic soundtrack is something missing in Mortal Kombat finally a real MK movie with real fatalities! This is how a mortal kombat movie should be! I just hope the movie is as good as the trailer this subzero actualy gave me the chills if they nail it i want a triology AT LEAST OUT OF IT or a damm serie loll tbh, it looks cool but the part i\'m looking forward too is Scorpion vs Sub Zero. And obviously there\'s gonna be another part after this one, mark my words. We can only hope Johnny Cage will be played by The Miz!! At last! A worthy rated R mortal combat film. At least it seems so... Omg I can\'t wait I\'m crying because I was waiting for this i got goosebumps when subzero did his iconic ice sword move Looks like a good concept, I seriously doubt it’ll be executed well though. The ""get over here"" aside, this might be an awesome action movie. Anyone notice how when kano shoots the Lazer from his eye in the trailer it looks like it\'s coming from his left eye? His right eye is the one with the Lazer. The trailer was 10 times cooler than the movie They really gave sub zero a justice  in this film this actually looks pretty good Awesome man this really what an action movie is all about Dude that sub v scorpion fight is straight out the game. This is gonna be a great movie. I like how jax\'s losses his arms in this, that was nice, and Sub zero as a villian is always the best.. Can’t wait!!!!  I want scorpion to win. Love this actor I love how the VFX looks amazing when the movie will surely not be good Bro this is 100% better than the old version just the trailer got me hyped like this if u are hyped Even better we all in the movies should scream “FATALITY” when it happens  FINALLY THE MORTAL KOMBAT I BEEN WAITING 20 YEARS FOR LOL I Can\'t Wait For This I Just Hope Its Good BEST MOVIE EVER MADE NO JOKE ! PLEASE GIVE US A MORTAL KOMBAT 2 ! I think they\'re still in time of fixing that ""Get over here."" in the studio with some voice-over work. It needs more impact and some diction. But so far so good. Looks pretty nice and I\'ll be watching it. I hope they know that expectations are high in general, because it\'s been due that these sorts of movies become good for a change. Looks incredible Oh shit that\'s pretty brutal huh, they really include ""fatality"" in this movie My inner child is crying out of joy right now When scorpion said get over here so badly a bit of me died inside Now 2021 looks really good  I can\'t wait!! SubZero just literally froze blood into a dang sword. Looks good. Wish they made it more dark and scary Movie gonna b so damn epic That “get over here” wasn’t convincing like the 1st one but finally Hell yeah can’t wait till the movies open up and I get to go watch this sick a flick I haven’t seen a sick ass movie like this since the 90’s with the original Mortal kombat I grew up playing this game  Can\'t wait!!!! Looks to be the best damn film since the Chronicals of Riddik landed The score just ain\'t do it for me i know im not the only one U know it\'s gonna be a good movie when u see Sub- zero fighting with Jian and wearing Chinese- styled shoulder pads, and Scorpion fighting with Katana with Japanese- styled armour plates  It somewhat makes me wanna play the game now. looks promising in some parts let\'s hope they will not dissapoint the audience the effect should be at least equal to the orginial Mortal Kombat movie... FLAWLESS I haven’t played a mortal kombat game ever and I thought this movie was good. Way better than the garbage you find on Netflix so I rate it like 8.5/10. Love Mk as a kid and I really like this excited to see this The sequel nobody asked for.\nYet, I\'ll watch it. This is look freaking insane! I\'m sooooo excited I must say, it wouldnt hurt for DC to start finessing mk characters as villains in DC movies.. I think that would really break some records Please don\'t let this be a let down like MK:Annihilation. Please don\'t let this be a let down like MK:Annihilation. Please don\'t let this be a let down like MK:Annihilation.  Waiting for the legendary theme tune to kick in but was left disappointed...  Oh man this looks awesome So incrediblely amazing  the original will always be my favorite but still cant wait to see this ! Thank goodness for modern cgi. I’m gonna check it out. I remember watching the old one in theaters and thinking it was so cool, but looking back it’s hard to watch. Lol Are we not going to talk about Sub-Zero freezing Scorpions blood into a dagger and then stabbing him with it... or am I the only one who caught that? Can\'t wait! Can\'t wait! DUDE THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE SO BADASS I just realised something, Sub Zero freezing Jax\'s gun is a homage to the first Mortal Kombat movie scene. Y\'all MK fans should know what I\'m talking about. ok this MK movie is going to be dope. seems they took there time doing it Sub-Zero has always been the MAN. Can\'t wait to see this. The two newer actors playing Shang Tsung and Kano, those are some big shoes to fill. I love Hiroyuki Sanada, he\'s the best Actor to play such Characters !! :D Oh my gosh I can’t wait this movie I\'m so excited  Excited about this, going tomorrow If they bring Goro back they better bring Johnny Cage back so he can give him another NUT CRACKER!!!  I have been waiting SOOO LONG FOR THIS!!!!! I will be very sad if this movie is a disappointment!!!! Mortal Kombat has the potential to be a HIT if they don\'t blow this up to be an amazing movie and it suck like they did with (Avatar the last Airbender). Mortal Kombat HAS to be extremely brutal!!!!!!!! ""get ovah here"" never gets old THEY NEED TO FIX THE ""ET OVER HERE ""LINE ITS THE MOST LEGENDARY LINE OF ALL MORTAL COMBAT NO CAP! Lets add a new fighter character in new mortal kombat movie, people will love it! Would score this one 7/10...Kano was hilarious though lol It looks amazing i hope the fight scenes and animations will be good Damn! This trailer turned my Samsung into shang tsung!  The fact that this movie is made and funded by WB\'s makes me look forward to it.\n\nBut the other fact that -- that signature call of ""Get over here"" doesn\'t sound intimidating makes me want to turn around and forget that this is a film. I\'ll be rooting for Sub-Zero  This movie was so good! MORTAL KOMBAT!!! The only saving grace of this trailer is the fact that Sub Zero froze the blood into a dagger and used it. Now that was epic, while the get over here from Scorpion was underwhelming... BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS SINCE THE CLASSICS THEY NEED TO REMAKE A NEW ONE “It’s a birth mark, he was born with”\nEvery 60 seconds here, a minute passes in Africa Choose your destiny!\nGet over here!\nFatality!\nHuh, memories! I remembet as a kid when i watched it in australia i was there as a refugee with my family ..we had a hall where we could watch shows and movies.. there were two tvs one wad playing titanic and the other one was playing mortal combat half way through i went to the room where mortal combat was on and i must say it was wonderful experience!! Godzilla vs kong got released\nMortal Kombat got released.\n\nDamn, I don\'t know which is the real movie of the year. that mortal combat movie gonna be great. the director is a true fan and knows what the fans want. thats what make video games movies amazing . cant wait till street fighter gets a good director and studio that resects the fan or give us a sequel to the street fighter animated movie . not a alpha but true sequel . Im back on my old days addictive gameplay on Xbox how perfect memories turns to movie ""get over here weak"" like the WTC7 demolition. OMG, I LOVE THIS! Who was waiting for the""get over here""line Best part of the trailer is when Scorpion says ""Giggle HeeHaw!"" @2:11 I swear Jax be getting his arms differently in every MK movie.... I hope to watch this on cinema.  Holy shit this movie was amazing  This is so Lit ...but i expecting Princess Kitana ,,, also Jade ....Mortal Kombat my Childhood  The MK music theme really needs to be in this. This sucks they didn\'t use Johnny Cage OR the most famous techno song in the universe. Ah man, that magical feeling of pure unadulterated nostalgia when I heard the legendary Scorpion deliver his iconic phrase,  “GIOWHWURHERE”.  \n\nReally takes me back to playing MKII on the classic SEGA Gemnurlsuz console when I was a kid. Back in my marching band days, we did a \'90s tribute with various songs, including ""Get Ready For This"" by 2 Unlimited. Since I was the only one who could project my voice loud enough, I was assigned the trademark ""Y\'all ready for this"" during the song. The final iteration, however, I decided to get creative, and, at the top of my lungs, belted out, better than my childhood version Very close to what a Dragon Ball movie would look like. Just make it already! (But make it a good production, not a childish cheap thing, make it a serious expensive awesome thing :D ) ""Get over here!"" doesn\'t sound dark enough My Johnny Cage theory:\n\nI believe throughout the movie, there will be some sort of ""leak"" to the public and the tournament will be blown wide open while it\'s still ongoing. I hope they get some more of Hanzo Hashashi next time Caraca vai ser muito top hell yeahhhhhhhhh..... finally what i imagine.... damn excited Simply beautiful. Ok,  so we all going to watch it for Scorpion vs SubZero, finally that Goro fightscene is gonna be fucking insane! i\'m waiting all the trailer just for the "" GET OVER HEEEERE "" Josh Lawson as Kano!! Soo good... Love Josh! Ok people\'s comments are legit I agree with what they said about ""get over here"" \nThat being said, this trailer looks legit to me like it feels as if they didn\'t half ass this movie\nI definitely want to watch it 1:55\n“I ... am...sub...zero”\n“Does it mean anything to you?”\n“I am the freaking coolest amount the guys” HOLY CRAP THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HEARD OF ANOTHER MORTAL COMBAT MOVIE cant wait for it "" Scorpion and Sub Zero... deadliest of enemies, but Slaves under my power "" \n\n- S. Tsung I can’t wait i remembered I playing this on Super Nintendo back in Elementary days. \nDang! So Good! Fatality! XD less than 4 hrs it will prob suck not enough time for all the awesomeness of MK  to be shown and displayed in a story telling fashion. It doesnt feel like MK without some hint at the techno song... i was waiting for it!! Esta si va a estar buena The best scene of Mortal Combat for me.. When i heard somebody screaming with a Monster sound...""FINISH HIM...!!!"" I would love to see\n\nSub Zero vs Scorpion Battle :D Epic movie if your a true fan of mortal Kombat!!!!!!! Can’t wait for the sequel Nice movie.. Brilliant effects  ""Let\'s make Scorpion sound like Christian Bales Batman but less understandable"" Success Can\'t wait ️ I literally don\\t care if the movie is just one big fight from start to end I\'m gonna fkn love this - 2:10 -- Get over here...  but when you do, please stay at least 6 feet away.\nGood to know that Scorpion is still observing social distancing.  And both he and Sub-Zero are keeping their masks on at all times.  Model citizens, they are. hiroyuki sanada, the man oozes intensity, fucking perfection, here\'s hope they make use of him Waiting for Subzero and Goro fight This looks awesome I just finished watching the movie. It was little dramatic, a lot of fantasy. Don\'t want to spoil. Just watch the movie and you will have your opinion. On the scale  7/10 Looks sick. Hope it\'s got the original mortal kombat tune in it ""I\'m subzero"" the best moment Ok, ""Get over here"" in the game sounds badass. The way this guys says it is weak as fuck. Scorpion is supposed to be like a demon from hell. Come on man!!! makes sense.  good to see this mortal combat series once more I thought the new mk game just had amazing graphics... Finally after years of losing hope and accepting this project will forever remain in the gutter with the rest of the Trash, we finally got a Mortal Kombat movie worthy for the fans. But there\'s a lesson here, always learn from your mistakes and eventual you will be successful. This is the only action fantasy movie I want to see this year, to hell with superhero movies....Mortal Kombat would be good to see a re-make of a movie like street fighter ( without Vandamm ) this time Finished Watching! Amazing! Damn this brought me back to my childhood days of mastering the finishing moves on Super Nintendo Who cares how he says get over here, it sounded alright to me. I\'m not even a big Mortal Kombat fan, but this actually looks alright. Raiden could be better and Scorpion\'s ""Get over here!"" is ruined, yet seems nice and watchable. Overall nice, but Subs moves do not look vicious enough IMHO. I hope it stays as rough and brutal as the trailer shows. Good Soundtrack so far but i wonder how the legendary original soundtrack will transform and make it into the move. very important for me tho Looks awesome, just needs the techno song from the original....... and Johnny Cage Absurdo top demais It’s about time they remade it. After Annihilation we deserved a remake. I can\'t wait to download this =) The biggest question I have is: will there be a ""Toasty!"" easter egg hidden somewhere in the film? I see so much update on this trailer,great music themes and also song lyric from sonia detail enough,yes I love it! The voice of sub zero sounds so epic :D finally a good one!! Any word on a second movie when the tournament actually happens? Also John Cena has to be Johnny Cage right? I’m still upset at the fact \nThat they didn’t cast Van damme as Jonny cage \nAnd Jason scot lee as Lou kang in the 1995 Mortal combat  movie Jax: Has Arms\n\nSub Zero: “And I took that personally” Bad ass , I wanna see a new street fighter movie It’s been so longggg it’s bout time. This one looks 10 times better than the original Mortal Kombat must learn from the Raid how to pack brutal battles like Mortal Kombat I know y\'all hatin\' on the *Get over Here*, but after listening to Evolution of Scorpion\'s ""Get Over Here"" (1992-2020), it seems quite good. The most they could do is add some sound effect to make his voice resonate or sound unnatural. But if you work it too hard, then it might sound too much like a silly game sound effect. I liked it, personally. Fantastic actor choice. Perfecto. love it Awesome trailer, everything nice but Scorpion saying ""Get Over Here"" could be much better like from the game , just a opinion :) Looks sick hope it won\'t be a let down Looks like it\'ll be awesome. I still loved the original lol *Nostalgia Level 100* \n\n2:10 Please do Dragon Ball next !!!! This was awesome! im already watch this film ,,its so adorable Me waiting for the music to start playing “MORTAL KOMBAT”  You have the greatest theme song in History. USE IT!!!!!!!! Convenient movie to make in 2021, every role has a mask. FINALLY NOW ALL I NEED IS A  ASS GAMBIT MOVIE AND MAYBE A 2021 AKIRA FILM FINALLY NOW ALL I NEED IS A  ASS GAMBIT MOVIE AND MAYBE A 2021 AKIRA FILM Por que tuvo que morir Kung Lao  Aloha from Hawaii ️ \nI remember this when it came out back in the 90\'s, good movie  THe get over here gave me chills for a weird reason. i know this is an unpopular opinion but i really like this tone of ""get over here"" Hey Steve, when Scorpion does the whole “Get over here!” line, lets make sure he sounds like a 12 year old who’s attempting to sound like a grown man. Bottom line\n1.  fix scorpions voice especially the iconic ""get over here"" or at least his tone. \n\n2. Please don\'t deviate too far from the characters Before I rent this I just want to know from some people is it worth the rental the original was good I can just imagine the new one would be 10 times better so if anybody seen it and it was really good let me know please thank you Poor Jax.\n\nScorpions Revenge: Goro ripped out his arms This is either going to be the greatest movie ever made or the biggest disappointment we\'ve ever experienced. just have Ed Boon do the get over here line. It\'s too iconic I hope they make scorpion extremely powerful so he just goes on a killing rampage. Omg. the blood,the rawness. I fucking love it . Please be good, might wanna work on that scorpion line though. Waiting for the movie for so long.. The movie was visually great, the problem is the story. The writers are trying to fit a really long story with multiple amazing characters into 2 hours 30 minutes max. Just make the movie into parts. Much Greater than the old one, magnificent Rockies ""GET OVER HERE!""\nScreaming and jumping like a little kid and scared my flatmates As a kid i would play Mortal Kombat on Video Game, and now there is a movie. cant wait to see it I like they’re really taking this to a more fantastical place, opposed to just recreating the Raid movies but with Mortal Kombat characters. This feels right for this... BAD ASSSSSS I think scorpion should look a lot more aggressive and intimidating. Looks brilliant the actors seem so perfectly chosen for all mortal kombat charcaters Joe Taslim as Sub Zero??? OMG.. so proud!!! hey anybody else wondering where Johnny cage is like seriously he was one of the first characters in the original game so where is he for this movie also seeing liu kang using his fire in live action is going to be sick Saya selaku masyarakat indonesia sangan bangga mempunyai aktor sekeren joe taslim.\nWE LOVE U JOE  Every kid who started playing Mortal Kombat on SNES and Genesis will go see this movie. Hope the reboot is better than the first ones. The first ones were honestly terrible. But I still love them! Can\'t wait  The ‘get over here’ aside...looks like they fiiiinally got it right. Now if MEGATRON and Optimus can just step forward. . . Waiting for second movie people. Really was a nice movie. I hope you make a sequel or series like marvel or Dc universe. Who else was a teen in the 90s when the first movie came out? Can\'t wait for this.\nBy the way, the Cole Young remains unknown looks great! LETS DO A NEW ONE THE FIRST ONE WAS SO GOOD.......... Oh\nEm\nGee !! \nMaybe they\'ll have the guys face pop up in the corner  ""You fucken beauty""...goosebumps Better have that 90\'s intro music. Everything about mortal combat, rocks where\'s raiden btw Let’s see then. There’s enough technology at our fingertips to make this spectacular. That is the most Gangsta thing I have ever seen, Subzero cut scorpion and made a knife out of his own blood then stabbed him with it, Gangsta  Remember playing this game on my guidance counsellor\'s computer instead of working on my college application! It\'s a good trailer but when scorpion says ""get over here""!!!! it lacks emotion and that\'s a big turn off. Best damn trailer I’ve seen in forever Baru tdi nonton film nya, gw baru ngeh klo ada Joe Taslim disitu jadi Sub Zero. Kerenn gilakk The Scorpion\'s  custom is purposely made less than the Subzero\'s disappointing  can\'t say its meeting my expectations....but you really can\'t have anything with mortal kombat and not show Scorpio saying his famous line Looks good  now I\'m only living to see the ""Grand Father"" Would love the full movie this trailer was better than every film thats been out this year and most of last year, apart from tenet, that is one of the best films ever made “It’s a birth mark”\n“What do you mean?”\n“He was born with it.” I\'m only 36 years old and all the reboots they\'ve done in the last decade have made me feel like I\'m 56 instead. Humanity isn\'t just selfish but also weak-minded if cinematic production companies don\'t have the guts to make something original, different and unique anymore. Yes, weak-minded and lazy. If that\'s the case than I\'m sticking with anime and cartoons that I grew up with for the rest of my life (along with the occasional 90s sitcoms because those sitcoms are actually FUNNY!!!) It\'s not like a have a social or love life anyway due to the fact that the social media as well as human selfishness FUCKED THAT UP FOR ME AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT STILL HAS A SOUL, A HEART AND A CONSCIENCE!!!!  Subzero and scorpio are the best couple ever  if kung lao is in it i\'ll watch it Dam. This shit gonna be sick ! Proud of you sub...zero️ All it’s missing is Johnny Cage, you gotta have Johnny Cage in this. FINALLY!! A MK movie that doesn’t look like garbage! Can’t wait!! ""It\'s a birth mark""\n""What do u mean?!""\n""He was born with it"".........NO SHIT SHERLOK Ну наконец-то, больше двадцати лет ждал римейка !!! Ive never thought of this before. In MK you can use swords, daggers, superpowers. So why not just bring a gun....I feel like a .300 win mag would drop even goro easily lol. I love MK but they al have weapons so why no guns? Watched this, amazing. WOW| Can´t wait! That guy from the last samurai is epic Kano character is essentially an Aussie version of Conor McGregor. I ain’t mad at that... it fits. I hear a remake of the original movie Main title music to which I have mixed feelings, movie itself looks 100 times better than original. Hope I\'m not disappointed Базар жоқ!\nДавно хотел,что бы сняли МК с современными спец.эфектами! 0:29 Oh, that sounds so much like The Force theme! This was a good movie. Kung lao dies :( and Kano switched sides which is understandable since in the game he’s in outworld side. At the end it shows Johnny cage is in Hollywood and they’re gonna gather a bigger team for the next tournament Love the movie it a good one I watched it yesterday lol!! Team Sub-Zero! Since the beginning. Kano needs to say the line, “ello baybee” to Sonya lmao I just can say that’s really great ""i\'m sub-Zero"" it my ringtone now Wonderful! i love this movieee Jensen Ackles as Johhny Cage would be fun... bring it On. Sub zero seems gonna be the best one \nEven thou he was never my choice in the game I bet Johnny Cage will show up in the end credits to set us up for the next movie If there\'s going to be a sequel, pls get THE MIZ to play the role of Johnny Cage. He\'s charismatic, witty and AWEESOMEEE  I really think it would be a perfect casting role. Just an idea. The original one was great, this one looks competent, so will be fun again.  It will be hard to match the music of George Clinton, and the amazing Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa who was a very memorable Shang Tsung. I wish Rambo and Terminator was in this movie Not bad. I\'ll check it out just to see how Lu Kang wins Poor Jax; His hands get crashed by every member of Mortal Kombat The Goro scene gave me goosebumps I liked the 1995 version and I think I will like this one to. Just wish they had the mortal kombat theme Remember when we watched the first one in the drive-in back in the 90s?.. they don\'t have those anymore.  this looks brutal better not be disappointed ive been waiting for this for years Lumayan bagus sih film nya. Cuma agak kecewa aja alur cerita nya kurang menarik dan terlalu dipersingkat banget, kyak mau buru2 di End gitu. Padahal harusnya bisa dibikin detil dan keliatan lebih menarik alur cerita nya. Kalau bisa dibilang menurut gua masih bagusan alur cerita mortal kombat yang versi sebelum2nya. The beauty of action movies\' scripts\n+ It\'s a birthmark\n- What do you mean?\n+ He was born with it If this doesn\'t end up being a train-wreck of a movie, I\'ll eat my hat. I realize using the ""get over here"" soundbyte from the original MK movie would have been cheesy, but my inner 90s kid would have really appreciated it. Jax Fatality Awesome!!  I guess after 26th years Scorp got old and shrank. It\'s just I can\'t find any other reason why this 2021 Scrop is so damn short. He\'s like 4 feet tall!!\nHe\'s not Scorpion - he\'s ScorpiOLD For the looks of it, it really take it\'s source material seriously. ""Get over here"" - best line in the whole trailer. This theme song is a representation of the movie. Please let the ""finish him"" be better than the ""get over here"" we heard! I\'ve been waiting yrs for a proper live-action SubZero, graphics etc ""It\'s a birthmark.""\n\n""What does that mean""? Mortal Kombat is one of those franchises that should be left to video games, most video games or animes moved to the big screen end up being completely butchered. Warcraft, Dragonball evolution, both MK movies...more specifically Annihilation. Trying to break down a franchise with so much background, lore, and characters into a 2 hour movie doesn\'t usually work well. Ok warner bros.now give us a sequel then a reboot of streetfighter thankyou...keep up with the awesome movies! I hope it will be an original pure Mortal Kombat OMG!!! FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Kano: Rips heart out.\nKano: Ya facking beauty.\nMe: fack yes m8 fack yes Noob saibot better be in the movie. Need to see his x-ray running kick. Guys before you get disappointed by some of the dialogues (NO SPOILER) I have watch the movie and when Scorpion says ""Get Over Here!"" it is much more intimidating and better than the trailer. Basically it sounds quite different. Can\'t beat the 90s one Bottom line\n1.  fix scorpions voice especially the iconic ""get over here"" or at least his tone. \n\n2. Please don\'t deviate too far from the characters Waiting for the next part. That “get over here” sounded so raw and cool We\'ve been waiting for this so long. Dont ruin it now with ""get oveheeaaww"" Poor Jax; His hands get crashed by every member of Mortal Kombat Just had to laugh so hard seeing Kung Lao being the blond european guy. Its gonna be like any adaptation in the last 10 years. Save your money, buy the oldschool games and have fun with your buddies ! If that’s the original Bi Han then that mean Kronika is still alive. In that case she needs to go back in time and find a way for him to speak clearly. This reminds me a bit of the \'realistic; Mortal Kombat trailer that came out about 10 years ago He didn\'t say ""get over here"". He said ""I want more beer"" SCREW THE CRITICS!\nTHAT WAS PROBABLY THE BEST “Get over here” IVE EVER HEARD.  Shang Tsung said ""In the beginning were the Elder Gods. In their wisdom, they created a tournament to safeguard each realm from the threat of invasion. Once every generation, the finest warriors must do battle to decide the fate of their realm. The winner will be granted a long life and great power. If one realm wins the tournament ten times, they will have the right to merge with the other and rule as they see fit. I Shang Tsung, emissary of the great Shao Kahn, Emperor of Outworld, winner of the last nine tournaments against Earthrealm welcome you to Mortal Kombat."" Kano wins... Ya fucking beauty. I am so ready for this! The first movies are a classic. Hopefully this one comes close to matching them. All the special effects doesn\'t work on me. Just when you thought Apple \'s commercial from 2018 ""What\'s a computer?"" was  bad.\n\nMortal Kombat — hold my sake the cgi is actually legit We want the Mortal Kombat theme at the beginning They should make a film with all the Mortal Kombat Armageddon characters:\nScorpion, Sub Zero, Reptile, Rain, Ermac, Chameleon, Noob/Smoke, Cyrax, Sektor, Stryker, Kabal, Dairou, Jarek, Darrius, Reiko, Fujin, Bo Rai Cho, Mavado, Hotaru, Nightwolf, Mokap (maybe not), Johnny Cage, Kano, Jax, Kai, Kenshi, Shujinko, Hsu Hao, Kobra, Taven, Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Shang Tsung, Quan Chi, Shinnok, Raiden, Daegon, Sonya, Kitana, Mileena, Jade, Ashrah, Li Mei, Tanya, Frost, Sindel, Nitara, Kira, Sareena, Sheevah, Baraka, Motaro, Havik, Drahmin, Moloch, Meat, Shao Khan, Goro, Kintaro, Onaga, Blaze The Graphics On These Games Just Keep Getting Better An Better Since the Sub-Zero in the movie is Bi-Han, does this mean that scorpion will win the fight? You might not believe me guys but I am actually waiting for this movie to start in the movie theatre I’m in it Rn to watch it lol This looks like the best movie ever made From memory dont the weapons come from the palm of scorpions hands? Or am i just caught up in the last movie adaptation lol. I wonder if Johnny Cage will be in it, i didnt see him in the trailer... That was the worst “ get over here “ I’ve ever heard . the 1997 MK theme song keeps running in my head i cant wait to put my eyes on it FOR THOSE WHO HAVENT SEEN IT, THEY FIXED THE ""GET OVER HERE"" IN THE FILM.  \n\nThat is all, thanks my only complaint is\n bring the real Scorpion back Joe Taslim 🇮🇩 a.k.a Sub-Zero  Better throw in that classic legendary theme song!! I do like the orchestral buildup as the trailer progresses. But unfortunately the trailer\'s story & narration comes off as soft and cartoony. Mortal Kombat should be one of the darkest & richest franchises - because of its merciless world & intriguing mythical elements. They should have had Sonya Blade presented more innocently (not manly and overconfident, as in this trailer) and increasingly frightened as the horrors of \'Mortal Kombat\' are revealed in the trailer. As the innocent one, your franchise is essentially her journey of survival - where she does have some abilities - but you derive emotion from the sacrifices others make to keep her alive. And rather than have multiple brief fights in a single movie - make it a legit franchise by focusing each film on the mysteries and horrors of a single or couple of mythical characters. Then have an epic & nail-biting fight at the end - where the audience can\'t be sure of the victor. If I had time, I would love to ""flesh out"" this universe and bring richness to the characters. I\'m sure it can even be done in a ""graphic novel"" format. I was all in until I heard Scorpion say ""get over here!"" MAn, I was eating for the Mortal Kombat theme sound! Common gotta have that classic. damn!!! its so lit!!! Alright, time to rewatch mortal kombat 1995 movie with the other old ones that is x10 better than this. The way Kong Lau dies is unacceptable and Sub Zero Story is really good. 1997 year movie most epic from all of those No doubt its going to be the best upcoming movie after Avenger Endgame The trailer doesnt really hype me up that much at all for the movie.. still wanna watch it though. hope its not as bad as im expecting it to be Sub z vs scorpion would always be  a must watch Me: Sees Raiden\n\n\nAlso Me: Look at How They Massacred My Boi Yesssssss this is fucken great looks so dope Good old times before scorpion was the ""villain"", dont know why people keep taking sub zero\'s side, ok scorpion killed him, dude sold her soul to kill him thats sounds actualy pretty dark, but he clan was extincted  ... 1:58 He formed a blade out of his blood gush & stabbed him with it! Some would say that was ... cold. i looooove it WTF are you actually kidding me ? How can it be that almost every character has an appropriate looking actor... How in the heavens have they managed to do that but Net*icks couldn\'t find a redhead ? Jokes aside I am happy that someone is making this. CGI looks ok, cast makes a good first impression and plot is gonna be likely batshit insane. ""I am Sub Zero""\n\n""What do you mean?"" Sad thing is, I can’t wait for this to drop the trailer is so good “Finish Him!!” Can’t wait. Get over here sounds like he is seducing him. C\'mon this phrase is extremely iconic to the Mortal Kombat universe, you MUST get it right. Im so conflicted now, i think the ""get over here"" and ""finish him"" bit was intentionally dumbed down, this movie is looking pretty wild Scorpion signature ""get over here"" is   This movie has a big reputation to live up to imagine all marvel heroes join mortal kombat finally scorpion depicted by a really good actor. Make Reptile Great Again!\nMake Ermac Great Again! Scorpion: Get over here!\nSub zero : coughing (covid-19)\nScorpion: Get out of here! Years of waiting for good MK. Still nothing... Amazing! This could be great or it could be terrible. I hope they don\'t ruin it like every other movie franchise. Btw, today is the 16th. Why is this the first that I\'m hearing of this? so much blood...I love it Im stuck in 1995 mortal kombat... but this movie is great... The ""Get over here line"" just killed the whole mood of watching this ... It would be cool if they made a self-referential joke about how ""combat"" is spelt with a ""k"" and not a ""c"" in ""Mortal Kombat"". \n\nEven in the games, things that are supposed to be spelt with ""c"" are spelt with a ""k"". I’m fucken pumped!! Hell yes baby!! Hope Joe Taslim still in MK Sequel maybe another Character subzero looks unbeatable the best  ""get over here""  on MK2 ARCADE SNES  I\'m so proud of Mr. Joe Taslim in this movie playing an epic character as SUB - ZERO. Well done Mr. Taslim 🇮🇩 Having Kano as an Aussie is cool, there\'s a lot more Aussie accents popping up in movies these days I want to see Christopher Lambert as Raiden again. It will suck again and I will watch again. It\'s so fun to never learn from your mistakes. Can\'t beat the original. AAAAAAA MY CHILDHOOD I am surprised that Kano is in on the good side here in this film. Did they rewrote the whole story and we should treat this film as new born of MortalKombat story? Ok! I never watch movies. I am not a fan of superhero movies. Never seen them..\nBut I can not wait to see this movie!! That ""Get over here!"" Is hopefully fixed by post production! Looks good otherwise. Why does scorpion sound like he’s talking into a Pringle’s can when he says Get over here  All I\'m gonna say, is that pretty much every fatality DO NOT Disappoint. The fighting scene is good the story is shit.. I just love the fighting scene and that\'s it...... one of those movies that\'ll have decent fight scenes and probably nothing more. It looks like a 21st century version of the previous ones, with better fight scenes. Hopefully I\'m wrong.. Not a bad movie...Kung lao was awesome and Joe Taslim from The Raid great job as sub-zero...needed more scenes with scorpion I reckon.... im waiting for a scene when some get killed, a voice will be hear ""FATALITY"" I don’t know if you could ever beat Cary as Shang Tsung, seriously doubt they did, but I also still remember the original form from the video game being an old man which I thought was pretty legendary although it was dropped. I also don’t think you could ever find a better Kano, whose part was way too small & smackable in the original video. Lambert did well because he’s a great respectable actor, but he’s not exactly who I saw as Raiden. I didn’t exactly agree with Subzero from the original, & I kinda dig what I see here, but I’ve known Northern dudes with eyes so piercingly ice cold you’d think that they were either part wolf or dead, so sometimes you might not understand to know who you’re taking from. Just saying, they don’t have to wear contacts. That’s not a buffet offer to every blue either, I know a majority likes everyone else’s turn atop their own. I’ve seen two in my life & most people from any contrast couldn’t stand to look directly at them. Both were treated like complete outsiders by most everyone, very isolated. I know that I could bring a natural gift like that past it’s bound neurosis barrier or prison & create physically disciplined strength, as if acting would ever be so difficult..? If you got so much money, maybe you could make things more interesting or portrayable believable? Just a thought, I’ll pray for you  I feel like this film will do some things really well and other aspects (mostly writing-related) terribly. I just hope this shitty bits don\'t overshadow the good things about the film ""It\'s Mortal Kombat. \nWhat do you mean?\nIt\'s a mortal kombat"" This is a must see! The only best part in the movie is when Bi Han attacked Hanzo\'s village . After that all ... look like .. hmm.. bulan puasa . pergi ke kedai membeli cincau.. Underwhelming execution on the iconic ""Get over here"" line. Finally joe has finished his head an shoulders script I feel like Jax will be present only in the beginning of the movie and towards the end when he comes back with his arms. looks good! Actually thats how get over here sounds when a Japanese guy says it.  And sure his voice might be more suited for the come here line more cus it would somewhat take away the accent but the brutal voice he has already Gak sabar mau nonton mortal kombat salam dari Indonesia  Annihilation is still best movie to date. Finally Kung lao appear! Get over here"" should be terrifying. MAKES YOU NOT WANT TO GO OVER THERE Can\'t fookin wait!!! That\'s a sick ass fatality he did to jax Lol I was born 1991 I’ve waited for ever lol can’t wait # mortal combat Buen futuro le veo a esta peli        . 2:12 chills 2:02 That was a sick move Ah Geez,

The Kissing Booth 3,"['5fKn0Dhj64w', 'JKEUKI3IuE0', 'sX1Kc1lZH9Y', 'Qwxqo0IESxI', 'E-bJ0zRmAfQ']","['The Kissing Booth 3 Elle: * has a hot boyfriend, an awesome best friend, gets acceptance letters from 2 Ivy League colleges, gets to have a summer at a beach house with said hot bf and best friend, and has countless people backing her up and being there for her* \nAlso Elle: “my life is so hard” So her problem consists of having to choose between two hot guys, two of the most prestigious schools and another FREAKING bucket list? Yeah totally relatable. She’s not even gonna pick harvard or berkeley. she’s gonna pick a whole different college to start her solo career in journalism like rory gilmore Has anyone noticed that this literally isn\'t about a kissing booth anymore ""My life is so hard"" struggles include: hanging out with boyfriend, fun summertime activities with bestie and choosing between two amazing schools where realistically she would never get into... Either she takes a gap year to discover “who she is” or she’ll pick a comepletely different college and Marco happens to go there or smn 😃 kinda like Lara jean If Netflix can make the Kissing Booth into a trilogy they can renew Julie and the Phantoms for a season 2 I like how everyone is bitching bout the movie right now but in the end we all know we’re gonna end up watching the whole frikin thing😂 The way you can just TELL this was at some point a wattpad book is just hilarious Dude please I can\'t handle with more Marco being treated like shit 😭😭😭 The problem isn’t Harvard VS Berkeley, it’s Elle’s inability to make a decision based on her future rather than the guys she likes in the present. Well I’m actually shocked it didn’t end up with Lee confessing he’s always wanted her because that would be the only thing that makes sense given the nonsense rules and him basically controlling her life. The only thing that made sense throughout the whole  movie was when she told him he acted like a 5 year old. I love how every Netflix movies makes going to Harvard, Berkeley, Stanford etc look like a literal cake walk. Hot Rich guy/girl + Big House + Football/Basketball Team = Boom! Admission!! Elle: “My life is haaaard.”\nMe, staring at Berkeley and Harvard: “BITCH-!” every netflix romcom:\n\n1st movie: quirky girl and popular boy somehow falls in love\n2nd movie: another love interest that is 10x better than the first male lead but doesn\'t end up getting the girl The story is Elle says all her problems to Marco he sorts it out...then she leaves Marco 😂 Plot twist: Everything from season one till now never happened. Elle is just day dreaming the day before she sets up the Kissing Booth She lowkey forgets all the lessons she learns after every movie ends If she doesn’t end up ditching them both and choosing a college that SHE wants to go to instead of basing her entire life around these two loser brothers...imma riot Elle : crying with a friend who looks like a Greek god in a beach because she can\'t choose between two A level colleges and two smokin hot guys\nMe : Crying alone in my room at 3am with all kinds of mental illness and severe existential crisis 👁️👄👁️\n....... Plot twist, she rejects both schools and boys, to take a gap year and ""find herself"" The whole “choose a school based on where you boyfriend goes” has always been a stupid idea to me. Like girl, choose where you want to go and focus on yourself It’s impressive how shows like this are still successful. Even after all this time, we still want to watch stuff that’s been done over and over. I feel like Netflix doesn\'t understand that their target audience doesn\'t watch the kissing booth for a super deep ending about finding yourself ... they literally just wanna see the pretty girl and pretty guy end up together I’m calling it right now, in this movie she’s going to go through this whole arc of trying to decide which college to go to, and then in the end, she will choose to go to neither of them. it will be something about how she just has to go off on her own and truly pursue her own passions and self, and that will be her big ol’ ""coming-of-age moment"". -_- This is the best kissing booth when it comes to maturity ! I love how for ONCE a writer did NOT romanticize toxicness/drama just because of love and decided to bring an end to it so they could all GROW TF UP, both friends and lovers! Plot twist : Elle takes a gap year to discover “who she is” i bet she’s going to choose a whole different college she’s totally gonna end up choosing neither and say she has to find herself and the end. The ending would have been PERFECT. If El and Noah both kissed at the kissing booth and get back together. Noah accepts the job offer in LA and start a family like Flynn did. That would have been an end of an era. Plus a great movie where it could represent that whether if we choose our career over our loved ones at the end our love for each other finds back its way . Plot twist: elle will get away from her ""friendship"" with Lee, a friend who doesn\'t support her in her own decisions and arbitrarily forces rules on her only she has to adhere to. She breaks up with Noah because she realizes she lacks the maturity to be in a trustworthy relationship with proper and open communication. Marco moves on from elle because he deserves better. Rachel dumps Lee because she now has self-respect and also becomes aware of his unhealthy obsession with elle.  Even though the concept wasn\'t about Kissing Booth anymore, part 3 was probably the most fun to film. They had a lot of adventures in this one. “I’ve got so much pressure on me” Girl your only three problems are choosing a university, spending time with your boyfriend and completing a stupid bucket list with your toxic bff. Doesn’t seem like a lot of pressure to me. netflix be constantly making movies that don\'t need sequels, while they be leaving out series that actually needs another season - still waiting for an Anne with an \'E\' s4 🥺🤞 The only thing that would make this sequel worth it is if she chooses the college she really wants and Marco over Noah. If she stays with Noah, who is yes the hot bad boy of all teen fantasies but not the supportive non toxic choice and continues to make decisions based on Lee\'s happiness then she has literally no character development in 3 movies. Marco wasn’t right to get in a way of a relationship. But he fought for someone he loved. in the end he accepted that it just wasn’t meant to be. The ending should have shown him, and that he finally found the one for him in New York City. He deserves it because he truly knows how to love Who allowed this to happen, Elle literally has NO real problems. MY PREDICTION: she goes to neither of the colleges and ‘realises’ college isn’t for her and she wants to do something else with her life. and she’s trying to find out who she is and what she wants. Then she joins collage late with Noah. 💀 Netflix wilding with new content. As much as I whine about these cheesey cliched teen romcoms I\'m still gonna watch em I found extremely hilarious that this white girl has the perfect life and struggles with the stupidest things 💀 If they would just have an adult conversation these movies would be so short. If she doesn’t end up with Marco I’m going to be so upset I’m so happy Elle finally realized that she has to be her own self without Noah and Lee. I guessed she wouldn’t choose either of them but find her own way. I laughed the whole time because I couldn\'t take it serious. Not the typical happy ending we\'re expecting but still a happy ending. Choosing ur self and own happiness and loving yourself is a sure win❤️ Even if we all know she’s gonna end up with Noah I’m still happy we get to see Marco in the 3rd movie unlike John from To All The Boys who didn’t appear at all.. WAAAAAAAAAAIT, Plot twist: She decided to go to Mexico with Marco and leaves both boys.\n\n\nIn hindsight, MARCO IS A WHOLE BUFFET/ Good character and 10/10. I love it when the trailer is the whole damn movie. Just Finished watching.\nElle gave me high blood pressure throughout the movie \U0001f972\U0001f972\U0001f972 Plot Twist: She rejects both boys and runs away with the girl Jacob played pool with. Just watch this and I loved it!  Very well done! Sometimes, the third movie isn’t as good as the first, but TKB movies have all been great. Love the actors….love the bloopers…..looks like they had a lot of fun with it. 💕 “A rich girls struggle” - a kissing booth saga I love this show I can’t wait to see it 💙 what a relatable movie, choosing between a guy who loves her and best friend who would do anything for her and two of the most prestigious colleges that she can afford by winning 50,000$. I hope she picks to go with Lee and that her and Noah\'s relationship stays the same they\'re a good couple 🙂 Prediction:\nElle finally gets a grip of herself, ditches the boys and files to South Africa and lives with what’s her face since ya know, plot twists. Despite the romance thingy that happens on The Kissing Booth trilogy, I have to say that this movie ended very well. The values came from friendship and family seen a lot in this movie. I honestly did not expect anything better than the first or two. This third one has less cheesy romance scenes. I feel happy that Elle has finally chose what she actually like rather than going to college for the sake of the boys she loves. Surprise Twist:  Due to unforseen circumstances, possibly a world pandemic, Elle\'s college of choice is only offering classes online, so she gets to stay home and keep all her relationships in check.  Netflix makes 5 more ""sequels"". If she doesnt choose Marco, idk what to do with my life 🌚 Sis is really crying cause she can’t decide between 2 prestige colleges and stressing over a list she made with her friend when they were toddlers. Lmao sounds so first world and privileged to me😂 OMG! Can\'t wait to watch it!!! Who\'s with me? <3 If anyone wants an actually GOOD romance trilogy to watch, look no further than ""Before Sunrise"", ""Before Sunset"" & ""Before Midnight"". Thank me later. we don’t need a 3rd kissing booth WE NEED MEAN GIRLS ON NETFLIX of course, it just wouldnt be a kissing booth movie without...\n\n1) 1:25 -  elle embarassing herself\n2) 1:32 - noah being mad at elle Amei o filme 💗 quero mais This looks like the same exact movie as the previous two. Just combined marco be like: why would you ever kiss me? i\'m not even half as ugly i swear if at the end she ends up choosing herself im gonna lose it😁 my favorite moments from the kissing booth movies.\n\n1: The prom\n2: The dance competition Ahhh I’m scared and excited..it’s gonna be crazy 😜 \nIt’s always an adventure with Elle 😂\nSo sad the movies are ending it should have been a show tbh 💁🏻\u200d♀️ It\'s a great movie. Some people won\'t agree but I am happy with the ending 💖✨An epic era ended 💔 Idk why everyone attacks Noah as if Elle wasn’t pretty much the same if not worse. Sis rlly got mad at her boyfriend cause she suspected him of cheating when she was literally flirting with Marco the whole time and then kissed him on NATIONAL television in front of Noah. She also led Marco on and then completely broke his heart. She’s not innocent in this at all. So if Elle does something stupid with Marco once again, NOAH SHOULD DUMP HER ""People pass through our lives, some of them fade into memories but a few become a part of who you are"" DAMN THIS HIT HARD. So glad I decided to watch and not assume the ending. Well done and good for her! She and Noah, in my mind got back together and maybe we can have a sequel series in a few years if they can write a good script. I\'m still rooting for Marco. Such a cool guy Just got done watching it and it was good but 🥺I want another one , it’s not over for me. Like come on , They grown now ! leave marco alone elle, don’t break his heart again. I\'m always reminded that they probably canceled ""I\'m not okay with this"" and ""the society"" and other good or potentially good series, just to use their budgets for this and "" tall girl 2"" This is honestly so stupid. Imagine having a hot ass boyfriend, a best friend, and getting into Ivy League schools and having the audacity to say that you’re life is hard. I know pain is relative and life is hard but shit if I had her life I wouldn’t be complaining Can\'t wait to watch it! 🤯 love it so far! 💕 When I found out it was coming out next month I screamed in joy😭 the whole movie is elle playing with poor marco s feelings Quiero verla ya ❤️ Soo are just gonna ignore that ending?? \n3 movies dedicated to a couple who end up breaking up & leaving us with an open , ‘will they, won’t they’ situation This seems very predicable, she’s not gonna pick either and end up riding off on her motorcycle I genuinely hope Elle chooses to go to college with lee, cause noah always does something that makes her rethink everything If there is ever a part 4 I really want Marco and Elle together everyone will go crazy for that ""People pass through our lives. Some of them fade into memories, but a few become part of who you are"" an excerpt from kissing booth 3 I\'m crying blood, why is this even a thing... I don\'t no why I cried so much on this final season..God damnit it\'s was too emotional for me but love love love it ❤️❤️❤️ Plot twist: Turns out she wasn\'t accepted anywhere, there obviously was a mistake in the system. She receives an apology letter from Harvard and gets into a local college. The end. Elle is definitely going to pick Harvard cause its the whole thing of the kissing booth and shes saying sorry to lee at 2:06 The best freaking thing I can say about this movie.\nCynical reviews tearing it up, piece by piece. Me fascinaron las 3 películas espero saquen más por favor My favorite horror movie! Love Elle and her hypocrisy, Lee is obvs the best character for his controlling and one sided rules! And Noah is Def not a guy who chooses to run away from all his problems The fact that this knocked Outer Banks out of #1 on Netflix is beyond me. C\'mon, in every single american movie there is Berkeley, Yale, Harvard, Stanford. I just watched it and I\'m balling out tears 😭😭😭😭 I’m not gonna be surprised if she gets into both Berkeley and Harvard, in these Netflix movies they always makes it seem like it’s so easy 😂 MAKE A PART 4 RIGHT NOW AND MAKE ELLE WITH MARCO BE TOGETHER NOWW!!!! As long as there’s going  be season 2 of Julie and the phantoms I can live with this If she doesnt end up with Marco or at least kissing him in this movie I will pack my bags, travel across the country, find the netflix headquarters, threaten them until they agree to make another movie just so that elle can treat Marco woth the respect he deserves and never EVER got in the last movie😐 Love this movie so much cried to many times😭💀!! I love this movie because yeah she makes decisions and it is confusing for her and that\'s what I love about the movies they made with her and it makes me really happy I\'d be happy if Elle chooses a college of \'her\' choice, not her boyfriend\'s or best friend\'s. I can’t believe this is the last time we’re gonna see Lee, Elle and Noah 😢 I love love love love it!!! You did it again Netflix 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️ plot twist: Elle picks a whole different college OMG I\'m so excited. I can\'t wait to see what ends up happening. who all want kissing booth 4 where marco gets what he deserves 🙌🙌 Alex Meyers: “Oh sh*t…here we go again!” It\'s funny isn\'t it? People die to go to this colleges. They study day and night. And not only she gets accepted in all of them , she is bloody confused which one she want to attend based on whom she want to spend her time with (best friend or boyfriend). Most people who get selected lose this things on there way. It\'s just so..... hilarious. Can\'t wait for her and Marco to get back together 😩❤️ We need kissing booth 4 with the happy ending 🥺🥺🥺 I searched up and there is no part 4 of this and I\'m totally crying because i really really love this movie like I\'ll never regret watching this even if i get old, This movie is my favorite so far. Just watched the movie!!! Loved it, ❤️ ""Dear Harvard , I love my best friend but I love his brother too.  \nHarvard : Boom accepted I personally love Noah and Elle I hope he supports whatever decisions she makes but they are a great couple damn it’s been this long and she still can’t pick a college ngl, it\'d be AMAZING if she ended up with Marco 🤧 all of the movies litterally make me sob cause this is all i want in life I\'m so excited to watch this I have already seen 1 and 2 looks like it\'s time for three haha😎💑 Plot twist : She chooses college with Lee but then decides she\'d rather be a beauty influencer, gets kicked out when doctored crew pictures of her surface, goes crying back to Noah, discovers Noahs moved on with Marco... Why do I love Marco so much more than Noah Fun fact: Lee’s actor is actually married! Also Elle’s actor had to film with her ex (Noah) so that must’ve been awkward 😭 \'Shut up and dance with me\' is just the perfect song🥺🥺🥺 They should make it into a series at this point. I’ll watch it. Though most of the things were unrealistic, I am simply happy with the way the movie ended. I’m more excited for this than I should be 🤣 Už se těším na další díl.😃👍 I\'m having a huge crush on Marco, I\'m just sad he\'s gonna end with broken heart again.. Ok but like I’m gonna cry this looks so good 😭 Me: * silently watching the trailer*\nTrailer: * shows tyler*\nMe: SCREAMS OMG, I AM SO FREAKING EXCITED FOR THE THIRD MOVIE! 😍 IM DEFINITELY GONNA LOVE THIS ONE . What I learned in this film was, self-love and finding yourself. Who\'s here after watching The Kissing Booth 3? ✨ PLOT TWIST: Elle ditches all three boys at end of the movie. She instead finds a girl at the beach. She moves in with the girl, tries to figure herself, take a gap for a year. After a year, she finally goes to the school she wants to, and not because of either of guys— I\'m super excited for The Kissing Booth 3 to come out on Netflix Plot twist: She wakes up from a coma and realizes it was all a dream. just finished watching it, didn’t expect that ending. I\'m honestly just in it for the storyline at this point 💀 jacob lowkey didn\'t look happy promoting it Let me guess, you\'re back here after watching the movie.\n\nMAAAAAAAAAAAAAN. The way you can just TELL this was at some point a wattpad book is just hilarious The ending in the book is much satisfying than the one in the movie Elle’s issues: Berkeley or Harvard\nMy issues: socks or sandles this movie isss eliteeee I really love it & I love that part when they went Go cart racing it was funny 😂😂 I think the kissing booth 3 is better  than the 1st & 2nd ! I HOPE IT BE ANOTHER KISSING BOOTH ❤️💕💕 Imagine if Elle and her bff Lee fall in love together 🤭😍  if this entire time they had feelings for each other but they haven\'t understand until now (kissing booth 4)  if there will be a part of 4 of course.. i was not expecting this movie to be that emotional. i cried like 12 times im not even kidding. finally the wait is about to end! i’m so excited to see everyone again! especially marco 😏 Kissing booth 3 finally watched it. \nPeople! Why are you hurting our feelings? Noah and Elle though😔\nTo think that they broke up in real life just makes it more painful 💔\nThose were my favorite maaan😭 fun fact: Elle can\'t think about what she wants because surprise surprise! she has made ZERO character development over the course of two whole movies and doesn\'t have a personality that ISNT based around the (specifically, male) relationships in her life The ending...I just painted a picture of Noah and Elle ending up again cause after 6 yrs when they meet I could still somewhat feel what both of them felt...there is still that thing left in them...both of them. I wanted to say, I\'m afraid they\'re stretching the story in an IKS way. But, I\'m watching this trailer and feeling it still has IT. That\'s the freedom of Art - as long something is magical. I hope it\'s as good as it looks. I love ""Shut up and dance"" song too. I like the fact that they didn\'t let elle or lee fall for the other or each other......its refreshing 😊 I just absolutely love they keep playing Killer Instinct. That just rules. Y\'ALL MUST WATCH THE BEHIND THE SCENES  AT THE END !!! THATS IT , LETS ALL BE HAPPY.  It is really funny hahahaha Im gonna miss them . I feel like Elle is just going to be single towards the end, like she\'s not going to try to get back together with Noah and she\'s not going to get with Marco either and she\'s just going to maybe....maybe choose a different school then the 2 that\'s offering or go to school with Lee...idk I\'m so excited! I can hardly wait!!! It wouldn’t be a kissing booth movie if Noah didn’t run off with his motorcycle The best part about this movie is now Joey and Jacob finally get to stop pretending they like each other Elle went from a pick me girl to a strong indepentdent woman which almost every other movie does these days. Really liked the ending and I\'m not hoping for a 4th one instead renew The Society. Whatever happens, I just don\'t want noah and elle to breakup. I will cry so hard if this happens. They are my favourite couple.They already broke up in real life and now I don\'t want them to break up in the movie too 😭😭😭 I’m lowkey so excited to see this movie ngl So this girl is confused about having a perfect life. This shit can only happen on Netflix It has been 3 movies and she still can\'t choose. It looks so good!! Can’t wait!!! I need one more part with a happy ending for everyone 🥺....I can\'t handle this one🥺💔💔💔💔..... Literally made me cry soo hard for Marco....nd both Elle nd Noah...they should get back 💕...they still love Eachother soo much.. Me re emociona , saber que ya después de tanto tiempo la voy a poder ver Omg can\'t wait loved the first 2 movies❤️❤️❤️ Marco and elle looks perfect together , didnt they! I’ll be disappointed if this doesn’t end with Elle choosing herself and deciding to go to Harvard ✨alone✨ \nI’ll also take her going to Berkeley with Lee or ending up with Marco, but the first option is definitely superior. I still don\'t understand why some people hate this movie. Btw  I ❤ it and I\'m so excited for kb3😁😍 Whatever school she decides... I hope she ends up with Noah. \n\nI love the first movie so much! 💖 The second is good, unfortunately too much Marco, love Elle/Noah in it though. I\'m excited about the final part! Pov: you come back to the comments after realising everyone’s predictions were correct these movies are the one that motivate me to watch my online class lectures as those look more amusing and realistic. Me encantaron las 3 películas  , espero la 4 me encantaría que saquen más aparte de estás 3 películas me fascinaron Elle: “ could i BE more lara jean” I think this is going to be the best one yet!!!😍😍 bro if marco gets his heart broken ONE MORE TIME. Waiting for Elle and Lee to finally realize they are soulmates \n\nOk guys let’s wrap this up!!!!!! Fan fact: you don\'t need to get into oxford or harvard to be more successful&rich or to be at the top!!! When you\'re from a third world country and watching this girl having a hard time about her first world country problems. I was like ""I cannot watch this movie anymore"" the entire movie but I ended up watching everything hahaha. Facepalm to this trilogy but I\'m off to watch the first part again pfffft Do we really need a third one? We need a second season of I’m not ok with this a lot more than a third kissing booth movie We want it\'s fourth part 😭 I figured it out. Elle can have a poly relationship with Noah and Marco! but my money is on Lee lol I can\'t wait to see this 😍 I hate this .Adding six years later does not give character development .The ending hadn’t given any peace or satisfaction to viewers.The plot was all over the place .And the haircut was just not suitable at all for her (No offense to people with short hair you look absolutely like a queen)I waited years to see this ending only to be giving less than half of what I was expecting.I’m sure y’all thought this had a good moral or them or whatever but really it was just all over the place .Never got to see how Marco turned out or how racheal and lee got back together . The very very end was disappointing .I wanted to see more from them but it was them just riding fricking motetrcycles into the freaking sunset which would have been amazing if they were together .Also I noticed there was almost no on screen chemistry .If y’all want to watch this ok but please don’t set expectations to high .Btw no hate this is just what i thought :) Netflix please give us a ""kissing booth 4""🥺❤️ I can’t wait to watch it ♥️♥️ My kinda climax (Fanfiction): Six years later... its the wedding day of Lee&Rachael (elle narrating the story- voice over) Elle is super busy at the wedding... and there appears NOAH after 6 long years..!!! Few glances and small talks.. The wedding couple\'s bouquet lands in elle\'s hand with Noah beside her!!! (Come on!! Its Kissing booth.. we deserve a fairytale touch!!) At the eveng Elle recreates the Kissing booth at the beach house for her BFF!!(Where it all started!) And the end could\'ve been with Elle and Noah at the kissing booth with the crowd cheering and the words ""It has always been you..."" That\'s a privileged who has literally everything but still thinks her life is unfair, i mean i understand it must be hard and confusing but if i had a boyfriend like Noah, a bff like lee, someone like Marco waiting next in line  and got into 2 ivy league colleges i would have been more appreciative. OMG FINALLY A TRAILER FOR THIS MOVIE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR AGES Waiting soo hard for this 😁🔥 cant wait for this movie 💚💚💚 OMG I cant wait to watch this. Already in tears Still waiting for netflix to continue the society. :( So sad that they had to cancel it. It\'s so good. 😭 You know what would have been a better coming-of-age plot? Not getting into any of those two prestigious universities, being criticized by her family for that, friends drifting apart, boyfriend breaking up, feeling isolated and depressed by seeing others move on, and having realistic goals to work for while also struggling with a part time job. And then, after this period of darkness, she finally makes a comeback a few years later, while also having body image and mental heath issues. Perhaps, she finally gets accepted into one of those universities for a Masters or something. And despite of having student debts, she manages to pay for it. That\'s a movie I would like to watch. soooo fun!!!  can\'t wait to watch the movie Everybody: Talking about her “struggles”\nMe: Is that the donut Tony sat in? 2 more days till it\'s out on netflix 😂so excited 🤪 I\'m literally screaming!!!!!!!!!! I am so freakin excited. I can\'t wait, oh my freakin word! Excited much for part 4&5😍🥰 I hope nice movie I can not wait I’m so exited this is something that me and my mom watch together I cried. The best movie out of the three Say The Famous Quote With Me: “what happens in the wattpad story should STAY in the wattpad story” All fun in games until she finds out the person she’s supposed to be with all along has been Lee✍🏼✍🏼 if only elle communicated with noah and lee instead of marco, she wouldn`t have screwed up so much. bro if I cried with the trailer imagine how bad I’m a cry when I watch the actual movie Noha e Elle juntos no 4 filme por favor 😢 OMG I LOVE IT!!!! ❤️ I am not an american. But I used to think like going to Harvard, Stanford University would easy watching these movie..After I Google these universities Elle doesn’t even stand a chance..God they make it look so easy in the movies. I didn\'t expect Marco for this season😭❤but guess Whaaattttttt! If the ending doesn’t end with her choosing Marco I’m gonna be so sad omg I really didn\'t expect that ending. Really really sad. \nRest was good\nBut the ending makes the whole movie worthless for me Everything with Joey, I\'m in! This is such a nice movie why I’m I crying so nice lmao why does the female protagonist always have to choose the college her boyfriend goes to? WAAAAHHHHHH what i love the most is their friendshippppp. I wonder whats the endingggg Marco is a way better guy and always has been, but who are we kidding? She\'s definitely going to end up with Noah. They just give us hope and break Marco\'s heart again oh boy...can\'t wait to see that she decides to take a year to find herself and ends up choosing no boyfriend for her and she probably has that ending montage where she talks about all 3 movies and she ends up going to the school and does that netflix cringe style ending I wish Elle and Marco get together!!Love to see Taylor Zakhar Perez again!!❤❤ omg ive been waiting for the kissing booth 3 to be released for so long and its almost here! Im so excited Omg I feel so sorry for her with having to decide on which Ivy League school to attend and two attractive men. Her life seems so hard 😓 AHHH JUST 2 DAYS UNTIL IT COMES OUTTT This shouldn’t even be a thing. Funny how kissing booth 3 was already finished being filmed way before kissing booth 2 even came out on Netflix. They canceled the society, grand army, and other good shows, haven’t even renewed Julie and the phantoms, but make three movies of this. Ughhh it\'s gonna be so amazing😍❤️can\'t waittt.... it’s sad that i still want her to end up with marco, but know that she’ll probably choose noah. currently jumping up and down in my room because i am so frickin excited for this movie!!!!! 💕💕💕😂😂 can\'t wait 💕 The whole movie was a crap for me. I am so disappointed bcz I waited so long for this. But the whole thing was messed up. Feel like I wasted my time🙁 I always say I\'m not gonna watch and yet... I love the kissing booth like a LOT. I’ve watched each movie 4737272727 times and have all the books,but I have and will never understand why they make it   as Elle is poor and has a bad life? She lives in a two story house, has a good best friend, has two hot guys at her feet begging to be with her, and has an amazing bond with Lee’s mom and her own parents? I think they should’ve not Made it seem as that, because in reality’s she’s pretty high mid class and has an amazing social life. I’m also talking about the movies, the books do not portrait Elle like that, and make it clear she’s popular. Don’t blame the actors they have no say in any of the script and don’t blame Beth Reekles because she also didn’t picture it like this either:) omg the kissing booth 1 and 2 are so good they\'re like my favourite film and im so hyped for the third I literally cried my eyes off😢😢😢😢😢 This movie is going to make me cry so hard :( When is it coming out I can\'t wait ❤️❤️❤️💗💗 wtf three kissing both movies in like two years and we still don\'t have season four of stranger things >.< That this could be one of the most ridiculous movies ever: YES \nThat I\'m watching it cause I already watched the others: ofc YES “You’re not meant to be with that guy” that is not how you win a girls heart. You don’t get to decide who someone gets to be with. It’s that kind of thing why she will not choose him. This is giving me goosebumps 😬 here we go again, break up then ends with apologies and understanding to get back together I cannot wait for the kissing booth 4! I would loooovvvveee a book or movie from Noah\'s pov🥰❤️❤️ i want this to come out I like how her choice would be based on the 2 guys rather than which school is better and what it has to offer This is gonna be the end of an epic ERA🥺❤✨....\nThis is my 4th time watching this trailor🥺🥺🥺🥺✨ Bože jak já se těším :) The way I know this movie is going to be good asf just like 1 and 2 Aww I love this my last summer moments before I go off to school again Finally a wait is over.. Thank you netflix make a good feel movie ❤️kissing booth forever 💋 I’m upset that the caption didn’t go “it started with a kiss, how did it end up like this?” That was a missed opportunity If Netflix can make 3 seasons of this they can make a season 2 for young royals! OMFG I\'M SO EXCITED Can\'t wait ☺️ I am so excited for this one My prediction for the ending was right 😂 They canceled Anne with an E and haven\'t made Julie and the Phantoms but decided to do this? Don\'t get me wrong these movies aren\'t bad but I was really hoping they\'d renew those two shows I\'m really waiting for this❤ It seems that Elle\'s main arc for this installment is regaining her independence, realizing she\'s let her relationships with others dictate her decisions way too much, and that her decision on where to go to college should be done for HERSELF and not anyone else. Personally I just think that Elle should pick what she wants. she has to perfect college desicions and whatever one she wants is the one she should go to . Marco and Elle better get together like it\'s so cute! Like 😭 I need their relationship to happen Netflix I AM SO FREAKIN EXCITED ABOUT KISSING BOOTH 3 The ending its really good! I can\'t wait 😃 don\'t try to distract me, i\'m still team Marco. fight me. I feel like this one will be the best out of them all I can\'t wait 🥰 OMMMMMGGGGG THIS IS WHAT I\'VE BEEN WAITING FOR ❤️ That was epic can’t wait👏👏👏 WHEN IS THIS COMING OUT 😭😭 IM OBSESSED WITH THE KISSING BOOTH Plot Twist: she doesn’t end up with Noah or Marco. She ends up with a random guy we don’t know 😂😂 This is gonna be so good! Okay ik what\'s gonna happen, she\'ll go to a whole new college and find herself 🥰 Do i think that this movie is worth watching? No. Am i gonna watch it anyway? Yup. At this point Elle and lee need to be together since they seem to care more about each other’s feelings than their own boyfriend/girlfriend smh The ending ruined this series for me Netflix movies are totally incomplete without Ivy league schools Just make it a series already🤭🤤😪 everyone talking about the movie. And me just trying to figure out how Joey king was able to act romance with Ex Noah irl Totally excited!! so nice!! look forwards to it :) the awesome thing is there always a true friendship This one is gonna be epic!!! Kissing Booth 3 plot revealed: Elle thinks she shouldn\'t hurt anyone so tells both of them she got rejected from Harvard and Berkely(actually hurting both of them equally but she\'s super dumb to acknowledge that) and attends UC Davies instead where she happens to meet Marco again, and then doubts Noah for being with some other random girl and back to square one. I am so tired of this girl having these ""life changing"" decisions of what Ivy league she wants to choose, doing these stupid childhood lists with her ""best friend"", or which hot boyfriend she wants to be with. Like my god. Wow, was just waiting for this 💝 I cannot wait to see this!! So disappointed. This movie was a literal mess lol, they just threw in basically every plot they could put in it and it obviously didn\'t work. This wouldn\'t have been so bad if they just kept it simple and made Elle go to Berkeley with Lee and show her struggles on long distance with Noah. And that six years later thing at the end was just a big NO for me Whatever the story is I love seeing them I just came to see when it was coming out AND IT COMES OUT TODAY 😜 Why do these movies feel the need to show the protagonist, who seem to do absolutely nothing about school, “getting into” these prestigious schools? Not only will it mislead/set a high bar for young kids, but it is honestly insulting to those who work their asses off to get to these schools. I get to see more of Marco ❤ and Elle and Lee! if she doesn’t end up w marco i’m gonna be so upset Wow, you have made it quite far, just a little bit more. Your speeches don’t whisper, they roar!! Because jab bhi “tune kaha”, adjes “ne sun liya”. THEY HAD TOO!! You’re so damn amazing. Now if we just haven’t given it up already, GO FIND YOUR NEXT CLUE! being a rich cis straight white girl must be so hard, i can\'t imagine the pain and heartbreak she must be going through. what a touching, innovative and thought-provoking trailer O final desse não foi bom seria muito legal um quarto filme onde eles ficam juntos e se casam por favor 😢 Omg she\'s having the time of her life with her best friend and her boyfriend after she got accepted to two of the bests colleges and she can\'t decide to which one she will go bc she doesn\'t want hurt either of them, I feel so sorry for her poor girl🥺🥺🥺 Honestly I feel like Marco and Elle make a good couple Marco is literally the better guy but I can already tell where this is going 🙄 Now I\'m hoping Marco and Elle can reslly end up together now \U0001f972 Im oddly in the mood to watch 1 and 2 again Imagine elle and marco omg i would flip i would of come full ammo 😂😂😂 It’s the fact that I haven’t even watch the first one 🤣🤣 it must be good to keep going like this MARCO DESERVES BETTER If u ever feel useless in life, remember that this exists. Omgggg! Feeling nostalgic with Stup up nd danceeee!! :) Can\'t wait for the release!!! Eagerly awaiting ❤️ IM SO EXCITED I am SO excited! Sorry not sorry I’m still team Noah, that’ll never change. He’s so sweet and adorable🥺😭 If I were Ella I would go to either colleges, she wants to go to one college because of her bestfriend and then the other college because of her boyfriend, I feel like she needs to go to a different college for her self. She doesn’t need to go to one of those to please them, she needs to please her self. Can\'t wait for watchinggg💖 Mmm, I’m just happy to be seeing more Marco. You all can have your fun complaining about the movie, but I’m good here. 😂 That\'s why I never got involved romantically in high-school 😂😂❤❤ I\'ve waited for this so long. I swear if she does not end up with Marco I’m gonna loose it 🌝 Noah: Don\'t me tell it\'s a bucket list\nElle: * SOBS *\n\n👏just renew it\'s okay not to be okay ffs👏 Omg😱 I can\'t wait ❤️ Let’s be honest we are only watching it to see who she ends up with. I would choose Harvard in a heartbeat Hey this is not done! We need 4th season of this.. the end was confusing and no one knows exactly what happened. I enjoyed watching this I cried as well 🤣🤣 but the end doesn\'t feel like an ending. Plot twist: she will reject both the schools and join Marco\'s college this looks amazing IDC IF OTHER PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS IS A CRINGEY AF MOVIE. I STILL LOVE IT AND STILL GONNA WATCH IT.\n\nWILL REWATCH THE TKB2 😂😂😂♥️ I have never once seen her STUDY. Not even once like frr . And How on earth does she get offers from such prestigious institutes!? And choosing among them is a lotta pressure for her? PFFT. To All The Boys is 100 percent better than Kissing Booth! I WANT TO WATCH THIS SO BAD Plot twist: ditches both ivy league schools, enlists in the military. I think this one is not as nice as the previous two but I\'m definitely going to watch the full movie. I might have a different perspective afterwards Can we have a season 4? 😭😭😭😭😭 Netflix can make this but cannot renew Anne with an ""e"" and The society Elle: I have a lifelong best friend, a hot boyfriend (who is abusive but the movies ignore that) and the highest quality tertiary education in the world is easily available to me. It’s so hard😭! My goshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!\n this is what I\'ve been thinking, dreaming and waiting for a long time ,so excited 😀❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ In kissing booth 4 we want Elle and Noah to marry and live happily ever after.. ❤😊 Plot twist: everyone finds out in the end she applied to and chose Howard University and she introduces the guys to her actual boyfriend Leroy, with her new box braids. I could tell I’m gonna be crying Kissing Booth wasn\'t the best movie in the world but for some reason I\'m always so excited for the new movies and to see the actors again because they\'re giving me such a good energy, Love you guys! ❤❤ CAN’T WAITTTTTT ❤️ Gotta love how every single trailer starts with funny scenes, happiness and then we get to see some problems that are gonna be in the movie. i lave never cried just for a trailer until right now People pass by ur life and some fade into memories ..........that’s d line people❤️ I\'m damn hyped!! I can\'t wait for August!😍 I am sad. I need to know who Elle ends up with macro or Noah I NEED TO KNOW!!! This is literally the same as to all the boys 3. Laura Jean ends up staying with the same boy from the first 2 movie. And does long distance choosing the college her boyfriend is not in. So Elle will probably stay with Noah and choose Berkeley or the school of her choice. So exciting 😁 I really think Elle is someone who\'s still uncertain about what she really wants to do, like obviously she have everything but still can\'t figured out what\'s best for her, she\'s kind of a girl in our generation wherein there are a lot of options and doors but you didn\'t know which one to open✌️ It coming Wednesday I am so Excited😋 made my heart do a backflip I love kissing booth I wish I had a male bestie their love is for real if she\'s not ending up with marco in the end then i\'m not doing this Been watching this movie series since i was highschool and now i already go to college but Elle still can\'t pick up which uni to go 😭 waiting for this❤️😍 in my opinion she has to pick marco hes always there for elle and he wont treat elle like crap which noah once did and he didnt even deny the fact that him and chloe are a good couple like wth marco has a better personality and doesnt give up on elle even though she thinks she has moved on marco is the kind of boy who will stick by elle through all her problems and help her get through it i love marco. When you have nothing to struggle with you create your own . PLEASE PART 4 ❤️\n😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 marco is such a good guy!! leave marco alone elle , dont break his heart again. Can\'t wait😭♥️♥️♥️ Netflix: HERE\'S THE NEW KISSING BOOTH TRAILER!!!!\n\nEveryone: Thanks, I hate it. I can’t wait to see it Literally she can still be friends with Lee while going to another school,maintaining a relationship long distance is significantly harder PLEASE PART 4 ❤️\n😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I can’t wait omg 😱 PLEASE PART 4 ❤️\n😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Rich white teenagers can’t complete their bucket list😢😭SO SAD I\'m in love with Chloe. Chloe supremacy<3 People past through our lives some of them fade into memories but a few become part of who we are PLEASE PART 4 ❤️\n😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Alex Myers is going to be so happy when he sees this masterpiece PLEASE PART 4 ❤️\n😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 0:58 “I have to pick a school and make one important person unhappy”. Elle, you need to choose the college that is best for you and your future. Anyone important to you would be supportive of your decision and wouldn’t be selfish by making you feel bad about choosing a college that they wanted you to go to. Kinda surprised that the trailer looks like it has an actual essence/story :)) Waited since so long❤️ PLEASE PART 4 ❤️\n😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 OMGGGGG IM SO EXCITED THE BEST DAY EVERRRRRR PLEASE PART 4 ❤️\n😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 IF ELLE DOESN’T END UP WITH NOAH, I WILL. Finally! 😭💛 Elle’s life is so bad between spending time with her sweet boyfriend and picking one out of to best university’s ever which she both got into and doing fun and creative stuff with her best friend. How is she handling all this stress i\'m actually so happy Marco is in this, not saying they will be together at the end but at least the other guys that likes her is there. In to all the boys, I actually liked John Ambrose a lot, but I dont think he\'s in the third one at all, right? Can Netflix make something about a kick-ass girl who gives off the ""you are safe with me"" vibes? No? PLEASE PART 4 ❤️\n😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 OMG SO EXCITED!!!!! PLEASE PART 4 ❤️\n😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 there was absolutely NO demand for this movie. i don’t understand netflix my life feels so boring knowing this is everything before she enters college 🙃 Happy Birthday Joey king...❤️ And can\'t wait to see the movie...🥳 PLEASE PART 4 ❤️\n😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Glad she chose her own path, pissed that she needed someone else to get her to that reality.  Glad that it leaped 6 years into the future, but if they never make a KB4 I\'m good!  People pleasing was the weight of three films and since her BFF is getting married, there is really no device to drive a 4th plot. PLEASE PART 4 ❤️\n😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Im calling it now, Elle will  finally  pick herself and like do a gap year or something  no Noah ,no Leah for about a year then she will go to college. I thi k her and Marco  are going to be great friends  and maybe  travel buddies. But there is no way she will pick a college  in this movie. The sad part is my need for a conclusion to a storyline and knowing I\'m going to force myself to watch this movie Plot twist: she realizes her love for the girl Noah was playing the thing with and they runaway together and live a happy life Im soo excited!! Perfect, its over now. We can all forget about this artless trilogy and (hopefully) move on to better things ITS TOMMOROW IM SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!! No one:\nMarco: singing to Elle ""So go ahead and break my heart again""🎶 These story plots make me laugh so hard they’re literally the same. But I’ll still watch it 😂😂 So she\'s gonna be opening up, confiding in and getting close to Marco only to discard him when things blow up and choose Noah in the end again? 🙄 Marco deserves to be on the poster man!! OMG! i can’t wait to see it.😱😱😱 The kissing booth nd to all the boys are my fav series n I love that both relate.... 😝😝😝😝\nRaise yr hand if u r a fan of the two i just finish watching it and boy it was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍 Plot twist: she gets over both Marco and Noah and starts dating lee🤡 elle is obviously gonna end up with noah lol that’s the whole point of “kissing booth” ""Maybe your choices have more to do with what other people want...Maybe it\'s time that you think about what you want."" Gosh this is really interesting. Yah know it\'s hard to decide on something so yeah...I hope she better choose her own happiness.😁 if they can make three kissing booth movies, they also renew all the amazing, yet canceled shows they have NOW on Netflix 😍😍 usually, I don\'t like love stories, but I love this one, everyone can relate to it..... Sabırsızlıkla bekliyoruzzzz🔥 Just casually declining calls from Harvard and Berkeley...no big deal. I loveee how \'shut up and dance\' play behind !!! It’s been sense 2020 that I saw kissing booth 2 and now it’s a 3, I’m watching this when it comes out… MY BABY BOY IS BACK!!!!! if i were elle i would choose the school lee goes to because she can always see noah at lee\'s house. and lee is her best friend. I hope she goes for the school Lee goes to.😇 Well I´m happy Elle and Noah broke up but Marco is literally the nicest person ever and Elle is a total idiot for not accepting him! I’m almost sure that Elle not gonna end up (in the movie) w Noah but I just don’t know why, like in real life they’re not friends anymore and don’t want to continue the saga, but in the ficcional world of Kissing Booth I think they’re needed to end up the saga together 😭😭😭😭 It’s so crazy how they make getting into college look  so easy😂😂I wish it was that easyyy😭😭😫 Who else used to hate chloe but now thinks she\'s really nice 😂 I really hope Elle doesn\'t end up with Marco team Elle and Noah!! ✨ I\'m so jealous that she thinks that it is a hard decision. Noone is asking her to choose between her bff and her boyfriend. She should not base her life decisions such as going to uni on other people. She should go where she wants to go. She is able to pick between Harvard and Berkeley, then she has the dream life. Also questioning how she got in, considering her studying seems nonexistent. And if I were to choose between my boyfriend and my bff. My bff, always, no hassle. If they make a 3rd one then they can certainly make a season 4 of Anne with an E Watched this since 2018, and its rare for me to look forward for movies and grow up with them cuz I don\'t watch that much, so you guys enjoy complaining, predicting and shading the movie. Im gonna wait and enjoy watching it later 🤣♥️. Mostly here now for Marco tho. Pls we need part 4🥺🥺🥺 Omg I seriously can\'t wait I\'m just watching for Marco. I want her to end up with Marco. That\'s it. did we really need a third one? i never even saw the second and still know exactly what happened from other clips or trailers. would have loved something unexpected like elle growing as a person or not feeling like she had to choose for her “favorite” people to still love her. OMG IM SO HAPPY ❤️🥺❤️🥺 TKB series is one of the best movies I\'ve ever seen. I can\'t wait for this one IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT ELLES HAIRSTYLE AT THE END OF THE MOVIE 💀 ""I have to figure out who I am""\nEllen you had 2 opportunities to do that💀 So you\'re telling me they\'ll make a third movie of this series but they won\'t renew Anne with an e Plot twist: she\'s gonna end up with a Rachael in a totally different college Amazingggg I\'m Hoping Elle Chooses Harvard With Noah And Marco Yessssss the scene where he and Noah on the beach and Marco tells Elle that guy\'s not right for you I can\'t Wait to see it!!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 Chad must be real exited for this one. OMG I JUST WATCHED  KISSNG BOOTH 3 . AMAZING AND SOMETHING TO THIN ABOUT OUR LIFE I don’t know why people don’t like these 🤷\u200d♀️ I’m just happy it’s still going and the drama is epic 🤙 I swear if elle does not end up with Noah I\'m going to drop kick somebody in anger and throw my phone across the room i thought she already decided in the last movie that she wants to to focus ""less on WHAT she wants to be, and more WHO she wants to be"" What a masterpiece i asked for season 2 of EVERYTHING SUCKS and I\'M NOT OKAY WITH THIS not this I can’t wait till august 11th I wish I could time travel Cant wait! This is me when i was about to enter high school! Like my parents wants me to go to catholic school while my friends are enrolled at public school 😤 and yes my parents did the decision and after a year and year and year i end up at rehabilitation home🙂\nThat was 20 yrs ago! But by the Grace of God! I am Good and stable now😇 if noah and elle don’t end up together i am DONE AUGUST 11 I CANT WAIT THAT LONG MAN I read the title and said ""ANOTHER ONE?! WHYYYY""\nand then proceeded to genuinely enjoy the trailer. Goddammit I know I\'m gonna watch this I think the ending was not that bad I mean even if elle and Noah didn\'t stay together but they still loved each other and even after 6 years they were not in a relationship with someone else.... So happy she decided for USC, great university 🎉🎉🎉 we need kissing booth 4. I feel like they just showed the whole movie in this trailer. I\'m sure it\'ll end with something everybody hated or saw coming. I wanna see her end up with Marco even tho she doesn\'t deserve him 🥴 Honestly.\n\nThey just don\'t make chick flicks like they used to anymore. Can\'t Netflix or literally ANYONE produce a relatable slice of life teen movie?? The mood swings, hormones, friendships, drama, insecurities, anxiety, dreams?? There\'s SOO MUCH to tackle when it comes to these, so why, why these kind of romantic stories of all things? I dont think the directors realize that a lot of people would give anything to have to choose between two hot guys, and pick a school, and have a list of fun things to do with your best friend. I mean, no one really feels sorry for her After watching the second part i didn\'t really want to see KB3...but i didn\'t expect this, the third really went well Even better plot twist: Elle is pregnant, decides to keep the child, doesn\'t get to go in either college, her boyfriend and bf go on with their lives and she stays behind being a single mum. Watched all the there movies on binge , got connected to the three but specially Noah and Elle I love them together. \n in my case there is no Noah \nBut I have fallen in love with my childhood friend like lee , I told him But he didnt feel the same since then we havent talk for years. I can\'t even have a eye contact with him. I just ruined everything . Instead of making our friendship stronger I just broked it I have lost good friend like Lee.  Never had a guy like Noah in my life who would love . Too long and stupid comment but wrote to feel free bcz I was missing him .  At this rate they may as well not stop until ""kissing booth: senior citizens"".... cannot wait 🥰🥰🥰 ""You\'re not meant to be with that guy""\n\nYES. EXACTLY. SHE IS NOT MEANT TO BE WITH NOAH!!! THEIR RELATIONSHIP DOESN\'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE AND IT\'S NOT HEALTHY AT ALL I feel like she will choose a college neither Noah or Lee are going too at the end and just do what she wants. looks so good! finally it’s coming to an end J’AI TELLEMENT HÂTE ❤️! I think the genre of this movie should be fantasy not ""romcom"". I mean literally,  who regrets Harvard, dude come on grow up! So this trailer practically just told me she’s not gonna end up with Marco 🤦🏽\u200d♀️ That looks amazing Damn this actually looks good I Prefer kissing booth 1 and 2 compared to 3 . I excepted more from part 3 but it is not upto expectations If Noah doesn\'t end up with the pretty curly headed girl and Elle ends up with the hot dancing guy I\'m gonna be mad... Who is here after watching this movie?? 😉❤ This one actually looks like the best one from those three Really really excited 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 Is it just me or does anyone feel like Elle and Marco - Noah and Chloe have a better pairing than Elle and Noah. I mean they are more logical, sensible and compatible. Yeah no I didn’t like the ending. Marco should’ve been with Elle yet they screwed him over, left him with no one and nothing (again). I’m pretty sure nobody wanted a third movie of the kissing booth… but you know what we do want? SEASON 2 OF JULIE AND THE PHANTOMS! I wish Noah and Elle ended up together 😔 We will never be free from this franchise!! Can\'t wait the date is getting closer and closer 💋💋💋 This is a Netflix movie, she\'s going to Harvard with her boyfriend and her BFF will realize they must take on life separated. If this was realistic or feminist she would quit both schools both boys and make a decision for herself like studying abroad in UK or a gap year Once again they use walk the moon\'s song💯\nWalk the Moon is awesome 👌 She cries because she can’t decide between 2 amazing schools and yet I cry because I can’t decide what I want to eat for breakfast Can\'t wait 😁😁😁 I know some times it’s hard to let go of the things you love but Elle if you pick a another school far away from lee your oh will be over I still ship Elle and Marco cause Noah and Elle have WAYYY too many problems It sounds like we’re all over this movie lol. This trailer was painful to get through. I already feel like I saw the movie literally need a Noah Flynn in my life 😫 this series is my guilty pleasure Well I just watched it. It\'s not what I expected 😸 THE ENDING IS SUPER SAD!!!!!💙 I feel like elle have still feeling for noah after 6 years. But noah don\'t want to acknowlegde it. My question is, why didn’t she apply to other schools? Is she so pathetic that she can’t go to school by herself? She has zero agency in the series as she revolves her choices around the men in her life. There are for more schools than Harvard and Berkeley even in California. OMG!! Can\'t wait love I can not wait💜Coolness This film ❤️ weird plot twist: she rejects both schools and runs away We want kissing booth 4 for marco!! Who all agree?? Marco deserved better.. this just seems like a summer discount version of ""to all the boys 3"" after marco  having to give her advice on noah twice basically says for all of us her decision isn’t hard, choose berkeley and leave noah please I just KNOW that Jacob must be happier than ever for this ending The Half of It was the best movie that came out of Netflix. Periodt This is going to be amazing ! ❤️\u200d🔥❤️\u200d🔥❤️\u200d🔥❤️\u200d🔥✨✨✨✨ One of my favourite Movie.This movie hit different.i don\'t know why i like to watch this movie repeadly. But this is first hollywood movie which take place in my heart.this movie is supper dupper hit❤🙏 Now this is just prime gold I can’t wait okay so let me get this straight: you cancel ianowt because of “covid precautions” and then you say oh here’s a third movie no one asked for I cant wait duuh in so excited!!❤ Im soooooo excited 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍  i just can not wait it 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Why so much emotional movie 🙂 So.., now after watching KB3.. wedding bells are ringing does that mean we are all invited?? And what’s gonna happen with Noah and Elle…?!? I can’t wait to find out!! Netflix the story doesn’t end there.. I want to see what happens next… I’m a KBfan💋 Lee is her endgame I can sense I’ve always loved this series ever since I was younger, and I can’t believe we’re already at the last one. I know I might get hate for this but I’ve always been a Noah Flynn girl. Marco is cute and treats Elle so sweet. But… Noah is just the og and I can’t picture Ell with a different guy when it all started with Noah. Idk is this just me ???? Probably is lol not netflix trying to pass this off as the epic conclusion to an epic trilogy that people will be talking about for generations to come.  😂 THIS TRAILER MAKES SENSE NOW Say what you want about the movie I don’t have one problem with any of the movies I like them I MEAN its not like they won\'t be seeing each other again right?? And like we live in a modern era really.. i feel like crying😭👏 Makers - How unrealistic do you want this?\n\nNetflix - Yes If my best friend said she‘d rather be close to her boyfriend and have a long distance friendship with me, I would be sad but definitely not mad at her. \nAnd if Lee expects her to go with him „because friendship-rules-list“, then he is not a friend. I watched all 3 parts. Least I like is part 3. First and second part is so interesting comparing the last part. I guess elle didn\'t learn anything from the past 2 years and here we are again with the bucket list,choosing between lee and noah and marco and noah 🤦\u200d♀️ I would be so weak if she chooses neither school and she leaves Noah for Marco and Go to school with him😭😂 I can’t wait for this!! I\'m so excited I gasped really hard when I saw this, ended up swallowing a fly😂 I want Elle to end up with Marco.... boy if she breaks Marco\'s heart again I’m so excited for this…I can’t wait. I grew up with this and TALBILB movie series ❤️❤️❤️ Wow, these people have amazing lives, everything I could ever ask for, and they still manage to find problems with their lives. Imagine how they\'d react to third world country people\'s problems. SO YOU’RE TELLING ME THAT NETFLIX CANCELLED SOME ACTUALLY GOOD SHOWS FOR THIS?!?!? Who wants Marco and Elle as the endgame? 😍😍🥰 How am I just seeing this trailer now?????\n  \nEither way it comes out next week so I don’t gotta wait to long I still hope she ends up with Marco. I can only go by the movies because I haven\'t read the books but most summaries and reviews say that Noah and Elle break up in the end so... but I\'m glad Elle is going to take HER future into consideration and not to please Lee or Noah. Still can\'t wait for the movie!! Y’all it’s not about Harvard vs Berkeley cause anyone could make that decision in a heartbeat, it’s about hurting one of the two most important people in her life. So excited and full spirit... Really waiting for this Okay I shall not be pushed into misery because I\'m worried about the two breaking up. Well if anyone knows how it ends give me the heads up so that I don\'t end up depressed watching it 😂😂😂 Ah C\'mon. This movie had Shut UP and Dance with ME in it!!! OMG, CAN\'T WAIT!! I\'m a bit miffed \'cuz of Noah\'s attitude. Like, dude can u just stop running away FOR ONCE, and FACE IT FOR GOD\'S FREAKING SAKE?!!!! STILL TEAM NOAH, feel bad for Marco but don’t like him: but Elle isn’t innocent. She suspected Noah of cheating when he didn’t but she went of and messed with Marcos feelings and kissed him infront of Noah. I love this GUYS this is the EXACT same ""problem"" as the last two movies! She\'s letting these two guys in her life control her life and not making any decisions for herself! It looks so good I\'m Excited can\'t wait any longer I kinda mad at myself because I’m still team Marco 😩😩😩 even though I know they won’t end up togetehr I feel so bad for her, she has so many problems in her life omg🙄 Better just watch this trailer than the movie. 😂 \'\'okay but this looks interesting?\'\'\nme, every season. also, me, gets horrifyingly disappointed, every season. After the production of this movie Joey King ran out of tears In love w this bruh 💖 Now im gonna watch it Can’t wait to watch White girl who is having a hard time cuz 2 attractive guy is in love with her and she wants to go to Harvard when her friends wants different. Wow! This is really sad and emotionally deep story. We totally needed 3rd movie on it. NETFLIX get what we want! Still can\'t believe this is the same guy who banged his head violently, got a concussion, terrified us and finally made us love to hate Nate Jacobs. I love this Honestly, she could just take a break, decide to be just friends with both of the guys and try to find herself and see what she wants. We don\'t need this, WE NEED ANNE WITH AN E AND I AM NOT OKAY WITH THIS!\nWHAT HAPPENS TO KAKWET IN ANNE WITH AN E? MARCO DESERVES THE WORLD PLEASE PART 4 ❤️\n😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 How in the WORLD did she even get accepted to HARVARD AND BERKELEY \n\nlike am I the only one wondering the fact that actual good shows were cancelled to make these sequels is honestly the funniest thing 💀 I would be shocked if they didn\'t end up together, these narratives are so predictable. 😇 Yeheeeeey!!! At last, I\'m gonna see this crazy trio again. I miss Noah, Elle and Lee so much. So excited 😍 ok, I don\'t care which school she chooses, I just need her and noah TOGETHER I need to see it I need to see it now Dude, im still waiting for Anne with a E season 4 to randomly showed up. soooooo excited She\'s probably gonna end up taking a gap year to ""focus on herself"" Getting into Harvad is really easy damn. Just hang out all day and chill. Can\'t wait for Cindy to react to this and restrain herself from pummeling Elle everytime she acts stupid Who already watched it ?😃🥰 I did 🥰😘😘😘 Should’ve put this funding to an actual good series I like the ending the kissing booth 3 in a nut shell\n-another list \n-fighting with her best friend over noah\n-crying Can\'t wait to watch it😍😍 I SWEAR IF THEY BREAK PRECIOUS MARCOS HEART AGAIN...... THERES GONNA BE WAR🏹 I will watch it first I love this movieeeee ❤️ If Netflix can bring back another sequel of kissing booth than they can bring back The Get Down !!! Comes out Tomorrow omg!! This trailer gave me the vibe that Elle will end up with Marco whilst Noah with his friend from college. This  was actually good better than one and two Me: Please...tell me that Marco is not going to end with a broken heart again\nNetflix: I don\'t know Why does watching  this make me cry if you get accepted to two prestigious school maybe worry about the school itself? the programme? the student satisfaction? the college life? the societies? the campus? not what two boys think? and maybe don\'t let your best friend dictate all your decisions bc i swear its all he\'s done in the last movies Okay but as soon as she slipped and spilled all the food I just paused it and was like “girl” BDBXHD WHY WAS THAT SCENE SO FUNNY YOOO I HOPE MARCO GETS A BETTER ENDING THIS TIME ELSE IM THROWING HANDS !! Why the hell do I never get a guy just to vent. That\'s the dream😂 Why do we need another one of these, Elle is a bad person who doesn’t learn from her mistakes and it takes her three movies to figure stuff out!! Why!!?? Elle, FGS on behalf of everybody, choose Noah and call it a day THANK YOU The sky diving with the drawings gave me very much Ramona and Beezus vibes Waiting for a full movie about time we got a 3rd movie!!!!!! the way they just showed us the whole movie with one trailer It\'s so funny how they betray Marco as the villain. Even though he is literally the best dude in the movies. Nice, talented, and a good person. Yet she chooses the asshole. What a waste of a trilogy. Bloody hell this is most definitely inspired by a Wattpad story Netflix this will be my birthday gift from you 😂 Woot woot. I made a kissing booth for the first movie 🍿 I’ve been waiting so long Have a great summer Elle, Noah, Lee and Rachel Oh my God I have to choose between two hot guys, and go to one of the best schools in the country and have fun on the beach with my friend, my life is SO HARD!😭  - this movie\'s protagonist Plot twist: She rejects both schools and runs off with Marco.🥺 shes gonna do the whole love thing again with macro, and noah and then end up with noah again. MAYBE she will get with lee, Netflix might throw us off tbh. honestly my wish is for chloe now <333 why do I feel she is going to stay with Marco! Omg but Noah is now going to date the friend from college MUEROOOO😭😭😭😭😍😍 If Noah and Elle isn\'t going to end up together then my life is overr I believe Lee was unloved in his life and that’s why he holds onto these childhood fantasies. He needs some heavy ass counselling Guys reply to me and tell me which college you think she’s gonna end up at i wanna hear everyone’s opinions Why is everyone in these movies so damn smart to be ending up in unis like that. Like most of the time it just looks like they’re having fun and messing about but they’re so smart to always get into all of their uni options I think Elle should finally do want she truly wants and needs and find herself. She should follow her heart and finally put her feelings before any man. She needs to stop and think for herself and be selfish for once and do what’s right for her and not what her boyfriend or friends might think. She truly need to focus on herself and find her true happiness and if that’s not with Noah then so be it. She needs to make decision for herself not her boyfriend or friend. Okay but the combination of Shut Up and Dance and a Wattpad plot just makes me feel like I’m in 2015 again I AM SO FRIKEN EXITED WAIT OMG I CAN WATCH IT RIGHT NOW WTF YAY Elle should stop focusing on the Flynns and decide what she wants. All her decisions revolves around them. I\'m so disappointed by this third and final instalment! I loved the first and second movies so much I was waiting for this one. By 20 mins I was so bored, it was like a pain to finish the whole movie. No proper story, bad ending. I lost around 2 hours watching this. The acting was good as usual just the script was awful! I understand SOME people want Noah and Elle together but let’s be real Marco is a better fit for her. This is like a bad boy good guy genre good guys always get overlooked and the bad guy always get the girl it’s unfair. give Marco a shot if I made this I would definitely put her with Marco But of course they’re gonna keep her and Noah together cause they’re the MAIN CHARACTERS. I think I’ll be watching this while I fold my laundry away, such a shame was really looking forward to it 😔 So she is not in love with Marco, but most comfortable to talk to him about her inner feelings on her decisions. Sometimes some relationships are different from friendship or love! I saw it now it was fantastic SPOILER ALERT: Ok I’ll be honest… the real reason I’m disappointed in this it’s because all I wanted to see was a hot romance between Lee and a girl with much more personality than Rachel, the big guy (just found out his name is Tuppen) showing that he’s grown into a proper man by apologising to Ellen for the butt slap in KB1 and eventually  ending up with chloe… and last but definitely not least See Elle finally take charges and getting her Marcooooooo!!! Then you can pick any school you like girl for all I care. 😅 I know the 3rd one is out but I\'m gonna watch it all in order don\'t try to distract me, i\'m still team Marco. fight me. Notice lee’s girlfriend is only in the first 4 seconds. Lee dumps his girlfriend, and realizes his love for Elle, the brothers get into another fight, Elle says screw it, and decides her relationship should not get in between there brotherhood. Damn it seems like she’s gonna take a gap year and ditch both boys but I still want her to end up with Marco I like how everyone is bitching bout the movie right now but in the end we all know we’re gonna end up watching the whole frikin thing😂 I can’t believe at one point I really liked this I can\'t wait I want her to end up with Marco I think they have the best chemistry & he’s so supportive. I feel like her relationship with Noah is more shallow. I know that’s not who she’s gonna pick though because this is just another cliche movie & heaven forbid there is anything original . Disappointing but I’ll still probably watch lol I already saw the first 2 might as well see it to the end I swear if elle doesnt end up with noah in the end then-😭✋ OKAY. I absolutely LOVE Joey King, people. BUT I CAN NOT STAND ELLE. I don’t see what the fascination is for both of those guys fighting over her for two movies. 😂😂😂 I don\'t know why everyone is hating on the movie. Like, I watched all three and I liked them all. I\'m pretty sure their beach house is the same house where they filmed The Haunting of Sharon Tate 😂 OMG YEEEEEEEEEEWSSSSSSS I WANTED THE WHOLE TIME Remember, we could have had another season of Anne with an E  and other amazing shows but instead, we get this :/ I lowkey feel like this part 3 wasn\'t necessary at all😭 reminds me of 13 reasons why, we didnt need all 4 seasons, just like we dont need all 3 movies if she doesn’t end up with noah i’ll cry honestly if she breaks up with noah i’ma lose it but at the same time she really needs to focus on herself! I really thought Elle and Noah would\'ve stayed together Awaw can’t wait Is no longer to talk about how I can\'t wait 12 more days until it comes out I want to come out this second if I told you how much times I watch kissing booth you and not believe me the first one and the second one that\'s my most favorite movie in history and then once it finally comes out you don\'t even know my dream will come true Ok but I can’t be the only one waiting on “The Society”, “Grand Army”, “Manifest” and “Shadow and Bone” at this point if the kissing booth got another movie, all seasons for attack on titan should be added 💀 there should be a drinking game where you drink every time she shouts “NOAH” or is crying. This girl: Christ I have to spend my summer in a multi million dollar beach house, I was accepted to two of the best schools in the world and thus have SO many options, I have a fantastic best friend who will stand by me, and two hot boys in love with me. WOW Life is just so hard 😢 Time to cry some more I mean tbh I think 2 was enough but I\'m glad they have decided to make this movie more about friendship rather than thirsty teenagers Surprisingly impressed with this trailer like I was never a huge fan of this film series but man it gives me so much nostalgia from back when I was graduating high school plus the whole summer feel of just hanging out with friends and having fun before starting college haha. Definitely be watching how this ends. Bruh if she’s really choosing a school for a boy she needs to think again The hype for a new kissing booth movie always is on a whole different level Honestly I struggle with Lee’s character a lot. He’s so attached to her and their lists that they made years ago. Yes Noah is also not the best but my real issue comes in with Lee. You can’t force your friend to live a certain way all because of a list, life doesn’t work that way. He’s the truly possessive one I think. If she ends up with Marco, I won’t be mad bc I’ve come to the realization that Marco is hot. I just finished watching Kissing Booth 2 and Boy am I so glad that three is coming up! What a great thing to start my day ❤️❤️❤️ Am I the only one who is completely confused at why this movie is even happening? I mean it is nice to watch and all, but it has a completely unnecessary storyline. Tbh I feel bad for the guys who is getting stuck in her confusion. I really hope they all get what they want finally. To all the boys i ever loved and kissing booth competing each other with who can make more sequels with same story 👍🏼👍🏼 Am I the only one who has been waiting for this movie since last year bc most of y’all be saying the first one was enough but I’m literally so excited for this one this character has been confused for THREE movies now i want elle and marco together!!!!🥺 WAIT YALL IMAGINE IF SHE GETS WITH LEE💀 At this point,every Netflix teen drama is about someone telling the lead character,""You are doing what others want you to do.Maybe it\'s time you do,what you want to do.""\n\nPfttttt. I’m sorry but I refuse to apply to a college where my bf wants me to go to. I’d go to the college that I’ve been wanting to go to my whole life. And if he can’t accept that, than it’s a done deal with us because if you love me truly, then you’d accept me going after what I want. Prediction: she will end up single \nShe will not go to either schools\nShe will choose a completely different school. \nNoah will ride off happy to never make this movie again Just watched the movie and I absolutely love it She better choose one guy and stick with him no more love triangles She does not choose to go to college with best friend. She chooses to live her life in a college where she wanted to go, leading to not go to Noah\'s either. In the end the realization of friendship and relationships if truly that will overcome all. Plot twist: the college she chooses happens to be with the guy who is attracted to her. kinda wondering how tf could she being offered a place by 2 supercolleges as she doesnt even seem taking his school seriously. i think im crying rn :\' I can\'t wait to watch it but I really do hope that she chooses to go to the school that SHE wants not just cause of a boy, she needs to stop trying to make other people happy and start making herself happy, she\'s a smart girl and she needs to start thinking better and know that her friends will still be there even if she doesn\'t go to their colleges. Like, I may be the only one but I would rather have her be single than with Noah and if she was with anyone that I really wish they would have made her be with Lee but I\'m afraid that if it didn\'t work out that their friendship would get all messed up. Does anyone agree with me ??. Dude I can\'t see Noah the same way after watching euphoria because damn jacob is just amazing with how he can make 1 character compared to another so different because the way he is in euphoria just crazy Kissing Both 3: teens having the best life only rich people can afford I love this movie❤️🥺 AHH Why is everyone so upset!? I am SO pumped for this movie because they are just fun! I\'d rather have 3 of these than 3 of most everything else lol like the After series. IF SHE DOESN\'T GET WITH THE OTHER DUDE IMMA LOSE IT! Love Noah since kssng booth 1 but I love Marco\'s personality. If I met a Marco IRL, I\'ll marry him in a heartbeat Omg I\'m super excited for the kissing booth 3!!!! I love 💘 this series and love to watch more and more...I watch the movie  scene on insta than my friends suggest me ..4 this movie 😛😋😊 and I loved it.. Honestly this one looks actually really good Prediction: She is going to choose the other guy and Noah is going to end up with his friend from College I think these movies would have been better if we focused a bit more on the friendship of Elle and Lee rather than all the guys she wants to screw. We don\'t have many movies about friendship between a male and female that doesn\'t end in romance. Kissing booth 4 will be about her choosing between two guys in college I don\'t know why people are hating on this ...in my opinion, I\'m actually excited to see this one, I like the other 2 movies I think she should take a year off for herself. To figure herself out, rather than making decisions based on Lee and Noah. It\'s her life, not anyone else\'s. Either take time off, or go to a completely different school. I was impressed with the trailer until the other guy came back! I’m sitting here thinking you’ve gotta be kidding why do they have to try and make everything so deep and meaningful! It is literally the last movie in a new location! After watching the trailer it’s like seriously the plot would be so much better if you got rid of the old love triangle. I get that they have to add layers to the movie or it would be the exact same as to all the boys I loved before and all the other trashy teen Netflix movies, but seriously try coming up with something new instead of reusing everything!  I like the cast tho, and after all this hate I’m still gonna watch it. if I\'m being honest here just my guess i think she is gonna pick Berarkly 100 percent i mean it\'s strange on how someone woud want to choose a college just because your boyfriend wants u to go their just to be with them   and i think Elle should follow her heart and she needs to tell herself on were she really  wants to be and not let people decided for her... bro i just want her to end up with marco i don’t care about anything else 😩😩😩 I think this is how this is gonna go:\nElle goes to Berkley.\nMarco and Lee also goes there\nMarco and elle starts dating. This is less of a prediction of more of a what I want to happen: noah and elle break up because noah realises he\'s too good for elle. Lee realises elle is actually really shitty friend and leaves to go to his dream college. Marco also realises he\'s too good for elle and getd with s girl who is right for him and elle goes to a completely different college and finds herself. Lee and Rachel stay together. Noah realises he\'s in love with chloe and everyone lives happily ever after. They can’t be serious. Remember people, live for today, forget about yesterday and let tomorrow worry about Itself :) wishing you all the very best that life has to offer. 1st one was good, 2nd Film was ok, but not well executed, however part 3 looks good.. maybe even looks better than the 2nd film? We will see 😁 I love this one I\'ve been waiting for this like forever ackkk can\'t wait to watch the whole movie❤️ I will miss the whole crew of TKB after😞 I wish this time she ends up With Marco , actually if she ends up again with Noah I mean why a 3rd season then ! I am still not even with 2nd season. They could have chose hotter, handsomer guy for Marco’s character. The guy that justifies the praise they did for Marcos character before his entry scene. Prediction: i think elle might pick that other dude and noah might get with that one model girl but idk i kinda hope elle stays with noah So basically she chooses her future based on a guy?I mean what kind of human gets mad over where your girl/friend goes to college..\n. You know you feel overwhelmed with family and guys but who you are not supposed to feel overwhelmed with? Your friends. Especially bestfrien. I don\'t think Lee is a very good friend if Elle can\'t talk openly with him is this not the same plot as the last one The whole kissing booth series \nElle was confused with her feelings towards Noah and he was also confused and she confused Marco too \nSo now it\'s jam Can’t wait to see the kissing Booth 3im excited love love the kissing Booth Their height difference is everything Plot twist: She doesn’t go for either guy, she goes for Lee This feel like To all the boys;Always and Forever I think the last 2 movies would be pointless if Elle doesn’t pick Noah because the movies have been about her relationships with both Noah and Lee! I like Marco but i think Elle should be with Noah and i also think she should go to Harvard but not because of Noah because that is an Ivy League school and that can be a really good opportunity!! Is it just me or do I want Elle to end up with Noah I JUST WATCHED THE 3RD ONE. I\'m so upset that Elle did not end up with Noah OR Marco at the end. I\'m so upset🥺 that being said, WHEN DOES THE 4TH ONE COME OUT?? This movie needs a masked axe wielding maniac. Omg what a hard life she has. She has two hot men after her and got into two unis even though she didn’t earn it. Poor girl It would be better if elle ends up with Marco and Noah ends up with his female friend..\nLove is not to be forced just because you loved them once.. people change so do love ..\nIf they feel love for another person it means they don\'t love the previous person anymore..\nIt\'s just my opinion..  I can’t wait to see this movie I really loved the others and now we get a 3rd Movie and I’m sorry for saying this but I’m team Noah and no one can ever change my mind but I also think Elle need to start focusing on what she wants and not what Lee wants or what Noah wants or what Marko wants she needs to focus on herself for a change because she’s always focused on everyone else except her she’s was to go to the school she wants not the schools lee or Noah want her to go to. Give us the second season of Queen\'s Gambit or we riot. istg if she doesn’t end up with noah I’m gonna cry. I just cried after seeing this \U0001f972 Ellie deserves so much better tbh HOW HASN\'T THIS GIRL PICKED A SCHOOL YET OH MY LORD THIS IS THE WEAKEST PLOT I\'VE HEARD OF Noah loves her so much....but she still can\'t believe that he could love her so she sabotages it by messing around with Marco. Great information...God so loved the world He gave His son Jesus that whoever believes in Jesus will have everlasting life. John 3:16 Please believe and repent from your sin today. Dont be left behind. I don’t think she’ll choose either school and decide to go to another all together also don’t think her and Noah are going to stay together, they have some trust issues that are really bringing them down. In Jesus name\nDon\'t want a song to back fire on me&be taken over by the flamers as they did the 🌈\nIs it hot or 😂\nClimate change? she’s gonna end up single because bad movies like this think being single is a life changing event lmao Dont forget to PRAY AND READ THE BIBLE ALWAYS , GOD BLESS - The Kissing Booth (2018) f\'u""l\'l M\'o\'V\'i""E\n——————————————————\nWatch Here ➽ https://bit.ly/3CWjnBF I mean Noah wasn\'t right for Elle, I wished she ended up with Marco, he\'s far better than Noah but guess what life isn\'t what  we thought.

We didn’t see him after six years later sense. He was just for drama Im here after watching it im hurt crushed sad that they broke up i cried so so so much im hurt i cant im done that movie was my heart it was my fav movies now im sad about it so ahahahhahaah \'\'cries"" I can’t wait Life is so hard on her she has to make choice bw two most handsome boys in town and most prestigious universities .. so sad lofe is not like this to any of your audience c\'mon Netflix ..!! Make something relatable that has some Point I\'ve followed this movie from the start. Loved it until the the end of the 3rd one. They should have ended with Noah & Elle engaged at least. I did not like the ending. Sorry. I loved them together😞 I WANT HER TO BE WITH MARCCO I really wish this movie would’ve ended with the first one. I remember people post this on their VSCO, people wanted to be her bc she was with Noah. Now I feel like it’s just so embarrassing, The third one seems so childish, A summer list we never heard of this one I think in the first one? I was hoping she will end up with her bestfriend Lee coz they look great as a couple...😊😊😊 Tbh, I think Marco is much better than Noah, they have same hobby , they know each other more \U0001f972\U0001f972Come on Marco!plz be Marco Team Noah🥺! I can’t get over these two. sorry, the dynamic would just be pointless. a movie about rich privileged kids with champagne problems. i cant relate whatsoever I wanna see Noah vs Marco in a fight Its like seeing 2 and 1 mixed up.Think they should give the booth some rest... Waiting 🔥 When she hit his ass, karma hahhaha This girl and Laura from To All the Boys I have loved before are so similar. No one is talking about it so I will...0:46 cracked me up 😆 Plot twist she didn\'t choose anyone.. 😂 😂 😂 The kissing booth 30 will surely be about Ellen making out with aliens and she will be confused in choosing between aliens of two different planets of the milky way galaxy👽😂 Please dont use Marcus as your escape goat again elle please choose him this time please 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻 This is getting a bit ridiculous now. I’m still gunna watch it tho WHY CANT LEE AND HER JUST MARRY  ALREADY I thinks she\'s going to choose Marco over noah💔💔😭😂it\'s her choice Whyyy do they have to ruin a perfectly great movie by making different parts? 🤦 People mad for part threee while me so happy bc I just finished watch two movies The story of lara (lana) and peter (noah) was much more realistic but this one is getting too unrealistic ... No sense of maturity and balance from elle in her relationship yet she wants relationship to work perfectly Haha these movies crack me up for being so fucking unrealistic. Its like ""if you are young and have money, annnyyyytthing is possible!"" lol Yeah most people cannot do this and never will. Are we making movies solely to praise the lifestyle of the rich now? Well they are the ones making the movies so I would say yes. That is the case. lol Ngl I\'m kinda psyched for this one love this movie but hate the ending.... thought Noah en elle would end up together... You watched the trailer...\nYou watched the movie So excited 😄😄😄😄 When well this going to be on Netflix Omg why can’t this movie be the happy ever after one lol. They always have fights lmao The fact that this is coming out the day before CIE results... 0:32 Iron Man 2 reference sitting at Giant Donut 😂😂😂 only 5 more days i can\'t wait Marco and her would be perfect I cried because I spent about 1 hour and 30 minutes of my life watching this terrible movie. first off... why didn’t Elle end up with Marco? & why did Marco even confess  just for her to shove him away & then never show up in the movie again ? this movie was all over the place & overall a waste of time. & I’m so glad Noah & Elle broke up. They do not belong together. They don’t look good together. Noah is a terrible boyfriend, Elle is a brat. & Lee is .. a confusing character. This movie was not worth it at all. 💀 YES YAYYYY 3 YAYYY Alright .... my prediction: she\'ll end up as a single..😅 a very disappointing movie..my heart after seeing “6 years later” 💔.. Watch her go to that college wit that new dude 😂💯 I call it  !!! Elle and Noah broke up and Elle moved to University of California instead your welcome 😇 i love this movie so much make a 4 She\'s all about lee...in the first movie when three of them argue.elle is much worried about lee.she don\'t want to loose lee.and the second movie in the thanks giving.she\'s more concerned about lee.she said she will going to fix what is worth saving and that was lee.i think lee and elle didnt realized yet their feelings for each other.i wish they end together.i wish theirs a kissing booth in college were lee and elle kiss...sorry for my bad english This girl doesnt do anything for herself ..always please others I don\'t really care for this movie but I want her to be with the other guy not Noah this is exactly always and forever lara jean seriously Even tho you already know what the movies is about or how it’s going to end up without actually watching the trailer, they spoiled everything from the movie the ending the sad scene the dramatic ones I mean I just watch a whole movie in like 3 minutes If she doesnt end up with the other guy, im throwing hands. Like the shes currently with have nothing in common just me who thinks the plot is basically the exact same as number 2... Can she just stick to one boy and be loyal to him!!! I know the 2nd movie was enough but I want a 3rd movie cuz I want her to end up with Marco I think Elle\'s doing a job because she\'s choosing Noah? So they cancelled Anne with an e and this shit is still happening?!?!? SPOILER\nELLE ENDED UP ON USC TO PURSUE MAKING GAMES (THUS CHOOSING WHAT SHE LOVE)\nTHEY PART SEPARATE WAYS BUT THE WHOLE MOVIE IS SOOOOO MATURE AND A WHOLE LOT OF ROLLERCOASTER EMOTIONS Can they atleast change noah\'s hairstyle now?? Switching her mind every now and then like seriously ... When this movie coming out on Netflix? The first kissing booth movie came out in 2018. The second came out in 2020. It\'s 2021. Why did they rush this? Yall might hate me but I""m team Marco...😅 i swear be needs to end up with lee on the third one I Feel like they recycle scenes from the other movies and basically use the same thing but change the lines a little in this 💀 I want Lee in my Life 😭😭😭😭 OK I’m tired of the kissing booth can we have some thing new for a change? I’m a 26 year old and I’m obsessed with these movies and I don’t give a f 🤫 So how is this different from the last movie ?? It’s the same plot LOL I\'d rather have Cuties 2 than this 🙄 The 3 is literally flop i guess the trailer itself is better than the movie. I\'ve been waiting for a year.\n#Disappointment 💔 Omg we need a proper end....this is not right....like a im watching game of thrones again...the .kissing booth 4 HELLA DISAPPOINTING. FIRST OF ALL ELLE GOT A HELLA UGLY HAIRCUT AND SECOND OF ALL NOAH AND ELLE ARE ENDGAME. THEY NEED TO BE BACK TOGETHER ITS A DISGRACE WORST MOVIE EVER. I WAS CRYING LITERALLY THE WHOLE TIME FOR NOTHING, SMH IS HIS NAME NOAH OR MARCUS IM CONFUSED 😭 WE WANT I AM NOT PKAY WITH THIS 2! Elle prob gon do something stupid like in every other movie smh 💀💀💀 Soo everybody  just forgot that she is a cheater ?? Plot twist she ends up with chloe. I mean ..Kissing booth 1 was enough I thought Marco would end up with her but no. But I kind a like that that they show that not everybody has to go to college for their bf. I thought it would be the same as TATBILB but no i’m sorry but i want her to be with marco Pair up Noah with his british friend and Elle with noah .and end this series nothing to drag more!! If elle is not honest and trustful in her relationship so just end it This is so stupid I can’t believe they are making another one and they cancelled tv shows for this? i- Fav❤️❤️ Dis one is fab series\nBut same type of character really makes confused I didn\'t understand what am watching 1/2)or 3 🙄 The starting 45 mins was so boring it looked like some low budget vlog,I couldn\'t wait for it to finish Isn\'t the black girl Eva Sinclair from the originals? she’s gonna end up with Marco i jus know it I wonder do they get together 😂 The only thing I want is Noah should not end up with his female friend (curly hair one) from Harvard!!! I am waiting Im going to be so mad if she stays with noah. I hope she dates the other guy cause if not there really is no point in making a third movie Just your average high school experience here Who do pick team Noah or team Marco This is the most useless movie that has ever been made 😑 Actually i liked first 2 .\nAnd 3rd...okieyish!!\n3rd part is something how one shouldn\'t be in real lyf!\nNo understanding between Noah and elle Miss girl over here is so busy with all these love triangles how did she get into Berkeley let alone HARVARD Strap in everybody here we go again If you can’t come up with a good story..why do you even produce it 🤮🤮🤮 why always marco find himself in a friend zone???? Best 🤩🤩 🙌🙌😍 Apparently Elle gets pregnant in kissing booth 3 Marco needed to punch Noah harder. Noah is such a double standard guy. I hope ends up with Marco,  Noah is just a big baby. Damn elle just needs to chill bruv Hello, what car is elle driving? The green one I stg if she doesn’t go with lee- imma be so mad MY BAD MARCUS!!!! Tbh i think 1 was enough coz 2 and 3 are same It comes out today plot twist she ends up with lee.\n(jk idk) Emran Hashmi! 😂😂😂😂😂 KB 3?? Seriously?? \n\nLol\n😂😂🤣🤣🤣 Wow I love the kissing booth 😘😘😜😜😜🤪🤪🤪 no Anne with an e season 4 🤮🤮🤫 I see a lot of bad reviews here. Boring? Nah. Deleting this download 🤣 Title should be the confusion booth😵 make this end already the kissing booth 40 ..assisted living What’s the song at 0.15? Wow it was so boring and the ending sucked; wth?? They kissed like one time and it was all rushy ""fun events"" and then just boring drama and ""mature talks"" also marco invited himself to that party which also seems to have been an open one at the beach that anyone joined and that was enough for them to break up? Lololol I only have 5 brain cells left. She gotta chose one of them yk 🤠🤐 Just watched it. Shit. Definitely jumped the shark. Terrible In the end they both will be not together i hate this lame ending 2nd part was good How many kissing booths can there be bruh they can make a thrid shit movie out of this trilogy but can\'t #RenewAnneWithAnE ? Netflix needs to fire everyone Y doesn’t she just go to the school she wants to go too. If they’re rlly ur friend and bf they’d accept that and not cry over it. Look how they massacr3d my man Marco What\'s wrong with this girl?  And what\'s happening in producers head..are you guys wanna release the kissing booth four Where ell decides who she wants to be with..Am i right? Watch Chloe get with Noah and Marco w Elle Jacob elordi is a love child of Pierre boulanger and timothee chalamet.. This one was so Rubish and boring!!!  I don’t think I will see it again. Number ONE was the best. what timeeee??😭😭 Everyone loving Elle🙈🙈 she is like a fucking child! Come on now she c\'ant choose between  a friend, a boyfriend and another friend Marko?! 1 was good enough now is going so repeatable and irritable.
